<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>119</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>DO SOMETHING FOR OTHERS

<li>	Many a soul in the battle of life
	Trembles with fear at the din and the strife,
	Bearing alone, amid trial and care,
	Burdens and sorrows God bids you to share.

<span>	Do something for others,
		Something for others today!...
		Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
		Do something for others today.
</span>

</li><li>	Many in doubt or in fear of the way
	Mutely appeal for your guidance today;
	On your demeanour the choice may depend-
	Are you concerned for the stranger or friend?

</li><li>	Many, disheartened by cruel deceit,
	Broken and worn by the pangs of defeat,
	Doubting, despairingly, helplessly stand,
	Waiting, perhaps, for your strengthening hand.

</li><li>	Many are turning away from the right
	Into the maze of  the shadows of night;
	Go to  them, speak to them, over them pray,
	Help them, support them-do something today.	
<span>	Do something for others,
		Something for others today!...
		Duty demands it, and Jesus commands it!
		Do something for others today.
</span>
