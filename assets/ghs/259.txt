<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>259  </h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”> MORE LIKE THE MASTER</h4><ol id=“song”>


<li>	More like the Master I would ever be,
	More of His meekness more humility;
	More zeal to labour, more courage to be true,
	More consecration for work He bids me do.

<span>		Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone, 
		Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own;
		Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
		Wash me and keep me Thine for ever more
</span>
</li><li>     	More like the Master is my daily prayer;
	More strength to carry cross I must bear;
	More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in;
	More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.

</li><li>  	More like the Master I would live and grow;
	More of His love to others I would show;
	More self denial, like His in Galilee,
	More like the Master I long to ever be.  

<span>		Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone, 
		Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own;
		Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
		Wash me and keep me Thine for ever more
</span>
