<li>	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
	That calls me from a world of care
	And bids me at my Father’s throne
	Make all my wants and wishes known;
	In seasons of distress and grief,
	My soul has often found relief,
	And oft escaped the tempter’s snare
	By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.
</li><li>	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
	Thy wings shall my petition bear
	To Him whose truth and faithfulness
	Engage the waiting soul to bless;
	And since He bids me seek His face,
	Believe His Word and trust His grace,
	I’ll cast on Him my every care,
	And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

</li><li>	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
	May I thy consolation share,
	Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
	I view my home, and take my flight: 
	This robe of flesh I’ll drop, and rise
	To seize the everlasting prize;
	And shout, while passing through the air,
	Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer.
