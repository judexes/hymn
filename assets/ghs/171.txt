<li>	Pass me not, O gentle Saviour,
	Hear my humble cry;
	While on others Thou art calling,
	Do not pass me by.

<span>	Saviour, Saviour,
		Hear my humble cry;
		While on others Thou art calling,
		Do not pass me by.
</span>

</li><li>	Let me at Thy throne of mercy,
	Find a sweet relief;
	Kneeling there in deep contrition,
	Help my unbelief.

</li><li>	Trusting only in Thy merit,
	Would I seek Thy face;
	Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
	Save me by  Thy grace.
<span>	Saviour, Saviour,
		Hear my humble cry;
		While on others Thou art calling,
		Do not pass me by.
</span>


</li><li>	Thou the spring of all my comfort,
	More than life to me,  
	Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
	Whom in heaven but Thee?


		Rapture
