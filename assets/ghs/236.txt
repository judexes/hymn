	LORD GOD, THE HOLY GHOST</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Lord God, the Holy Ghost,
	In this accepted hour,
	As on the day of Pentecost,
	Descend in all Thy power!

</li><li>	We meet with one accord 
	In our appointed place,
	And wait the promise of our Lord,
	The Spirit of all grace.

</li><li>	Like mighty rushing wind
	Upon the waves beneath,
	Move with one impulse every mind,
	One soul, one feeling breathe.

</li><li>	The young, the old, inspire
	With wisdom from above,
	And give us hearts and tongues of fire
	To pray, and praise, and love.

</li><li>	Spirit of Light, explore
	And chase our gloom away,
	With lustre shining more and more
	Unto the perfect day!


</li><li>	Spirit of Truth, be Thou
	In life and death our Guide!
	O Spirit of Adoption, now
	May we be sanctified.
