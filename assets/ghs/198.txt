<li>	I do not ask to see the way
	My feet will have to tread;
	But only that my soul may feed
	Upon the living Bread.
	’Tis better far that I should walk
	By faith close to His side -
	I may not know the way I go,
	But oh, I know my Guide.

<span>	His love ..... can never fail,
		His love ..... can never fail;
		My soul is satisfied to know
		His love can never fail.
</span>

</li><li>	And if my feet would go astray,
	They cannot, for I know,
	That Jesus guides my falt’ring steps.
	As joyfully I go,
	And tho’ I may not see His face,
	My faith is strong and clear,
	That in each hour of sore distress
	My Saviour will be near.

</li><li>	I will not fear, tho’ darkness come
	Abroad o’er all the land,
	If I may only feel the touch
	Of His own loving hand.
	And tho’  I tremble when I think
	How weak I am, how frail,
	My soul is satisfied to know
	His love can never fail.

<span>	His love ..... can never fail,
		His love ..... can never fail;
		My soul is satisfied to know
		His love can never fail.
