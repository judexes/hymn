	SOMEBODY ELSE NEEDS HIM, TOO

<li>	If  you’ve found Jesus the Friend that you need,
	If  He is loving and true,
	If you have found Him a Saviour indeed,
	Somebody else needs Him, too...

<span>	Somebody somewhere perhaps at your side;
		Someone is waiting for you;...
		Say that for all Jesus suffered and died;
		They-need Him, they need Him, too...
</span>

</li><li>	If you are happy, and praise fills your heart,
	Trust Him to carry you through;
	If  He His Spirit and love can impart,
	Somebody else needs Him, too...


</li><li>	If you have comfort in being God’s child,
	If He is faithful to you,
	Think, when you see those whom sin has defiled,
	Somebody else needs Him, too....

</li><li>	When the Lord gives you His love and His care,
	Something He gives you to do;
	You have the gospel with others to share,
	Somebody else needs Him, too...

<span>	Somebody somewhere perhaps at your side;
		Someone is waiting for you;...
		Say that for all Jesus suffered and died;
		They-need Him, they need Him, too...
