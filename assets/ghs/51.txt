<li>	There’s a blessed land that we call Canaan,
	Land of promise, land of victory,
	Where the Spirit’s given  without  measure,
	Where the soul from self has been set free.

<span>	It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
		Where the milk and honey flow,
		Where the land is bearing in abundance
		And the grapes of Eschol grow.
		It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
		Just a lovely place to dwell.
		Won’t you join that band where the life is grand,
		In that blessed Canaan land?
</span>


</li><li>	In the land of Canaan there is blessing,
	All His fullness as He takes control,
	Blessed fullness of the Holy Spirit;
	O what glory He brings to the soul!

</li><li>	Have you crossed the Jordan into Canaan,
	Have you left the wilderness behind
	And received the Spirit in His full-ness?
	If you haven’t then make up your mind.

<span>	It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
		Where the milk and honey flow,
		Where the land is bearing in abundance
		And the grapes of Eschol grow.
		It is wonderful to live in Canaan,
		Just a lovely place to dwell.
		Won’t you join that band where the life is grand,
		In that blessed Canaan land?
