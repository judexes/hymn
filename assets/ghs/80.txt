<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>80</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	AT THE CROSS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Alas, and did my Saviour bleed?
	And did my Sovereign die?
	Would He devote that sacred head
	For such a worm as I?

<span>	At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
		And the burden of my heart rolled away (rolled away),
		It was there by faith I received my sight,
		And now I am happy all the day!
</span>

</li><li>	Was it for crimes that I have done,
	He groaned upon the tree?
	Amazing pity! grace unknown!
	And love beyond degree!

</li><li>	Well might the sun in darkness hide,
	And shut his glories in, 
	When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
	For man the creature’s sin.

</li><li>	But drops of grief can ne’er repay
	The debt of love I owe:
	Here, Lord, I gave myself away,
	’Tis all that I can do!

<span>	At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
		And the burden of my heart rolled away (rolled away),
		It was there by faith I received my sight,
		And now I am happy all the day!
</span>
