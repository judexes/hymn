</li><li>	Wonderful story of love; though you are far away;
	Wonderful story of love; still He doth call to-day;
	Calling from Calvary’s mountain, 
	Down from the crystal bright fountain,
	E’en from the dawn of creation, 
	Wonderful story of love.

</li><li>	Wonderful story of love; Jesus provides a rest;
	Wonderful story of love; for all the pure and blest,
	Rest in those mansions above us,
	With those who’ve gone on before us,
	Singing the rapturous chorus,
	Wonderful story of love.
