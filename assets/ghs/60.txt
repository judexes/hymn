<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>60</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	WHERE COULD I GO?</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Living below in this old sinful world,
	Hardly a comfort can afford;
	Striving alone to face temptations sore,
	Where could I go but to the Lord?

<span>	Where could I go, O where could I go,
		Seeking a refuge for my soul?
		

		Needing a friend to help me in the end,
		Where could I go but to the Lord?
</span>

</li><li>	Neighbours are kind, I love them ev’ry one,
	We get along in sweet accord;
	But when my soul needs manna from above,
	Where could I go but to the Lord?

</li><li>	Life here is grand with friends I love so dear,
	Comfort I get from God’s own Word;
	Yet when I face the chilling hand of death,
	Where could I go but to the Lord?

<span>	Where could I go, O where could I go,
		Seeking a refuge for my soul?
		

		Needing a friend to help me in the end,
		Where could I go but to the Lord?
</span>

</li></ol></div>
