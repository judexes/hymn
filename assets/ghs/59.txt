<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>59</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	LITTLE IS MUCH WHEN GOD IS IN IT

<li>	In the harvest field now ripened
	There’s a work for all to do;
	Hark! the voice of God is calling,
	To the harvest calling you.

<span>	Little is much, when God is in it!
		Labour not for wealth or fame;
		There’s a crown and you can win it,
		If you’ll go in Jesus’ name.
</span>

</li><li>	Does the place you’re called to labour
	Seem so small and little known?
	It is great if God is in it,
	And He’ll not forget His own.

</li><li>	Are you laid aside from service,
	Body worn from toil and care?
	You can still be in the battle
	In the sacred place of pray’r.

</li><li>	When the conflict here is ended
	And our race on earth is run,
	He will say, if we are faithful,
	“Welcome home, my child - well done.”

<span>	Little is much, when God is in it!
		Labour not for wealth or fame;
		There’s a crown and you can win it,
		If you’ll go in Jesus’ name.
