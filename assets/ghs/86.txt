<li>	Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
	Let me Thy glory see, 
	Draw my soul close to Thee;
	Then speak in love to me -
	Nothing between, Nothing between.

</li><li>	Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
	Let not earth’s din and noise
	Stifle Thy still small voice;
	In it let me rejoice -
	Nothing between, Nothing between.

</li><li>	Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
	Nothing of earthly care,
	Nothing of tear or prayer,
	No robe that self may wear -
	Nothing between, Nothing between. 

</li><li>	Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
	Unbelief disappear,
	Vanish each doubt and fear,
	Fading when Thou art near -
	Nothing between, Nothing between.

</li><li>	Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
	Till Thine eternal light,
	Rising on earth’s dark night,
	Bursts on my open sight -
	Nothing between, Nothing between.
