<li>	Marvelous message we bring,
	Glorious carol we sing,
	Wonderful word of the King:
	Jesus is coming again!...

<span>	Coming again, coming again;
		May be morning, may be noon,
		May be evening and may be soon!
		Coming again, coming again;
		O what a wonderful day it will be!
		Jesus is coming again!
</span>


</li><li>	Forest and flower exclaim,
	Mountain and meadow the same,
	All earth and heaven proclaim:
	Jesus is coming again!...

</li><li>	Standing before Him at last,
	Trial and trouble all past,
	Crowns at His feet we will cast:
	Jesus is coming again!...

<span>	Coming again, coming again;
		May be morning, may be noon,
		May be evening and may be soon!
		Coming again, coming again;
		O what a wonderful day it will be!
		Jesus is coming again!
</span>
