<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>114 </h4><h4 class="hymn-title"> BRIGHTEN THE CORNER WHERE YOU ARE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Do not wait until some deed of greatness
	  you may do,
	Do not wait to shed your light afar;
	To the many duties ever near you now be true,
	Brighten the corner where you are.

<span>	Brighten the corner where you are!
		Brighten the corner where you are !
		Someone far from harbor  you may guide across the bar, 
		Brighten the corner where you are.
</span>

</li><li>	Just above are clouded skies that you may 			  help to clear,
	Let not narrow self your way debar;
	Tho’ into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer,
	Brighten the corner where you are.

</li><li>	Here for all your talent you may surely 
	  find a need,
	Here reflect the Bright and Morning Star,
	Even from your humble hand the bread of life may  feed,
	Brighten the corner where you are.

<span>	Brighten the corner where you are!
		Brighten the corner where you are !
		Someone far from harbor  you may guide across the bar, 
		Brighten the corner where you are.
</span>
