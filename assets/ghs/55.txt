<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>55</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	ANYWHERE WITH JESUS

<li>	Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go;
	Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
	Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
	Anywhere with Jesus, I am not afraid.

<span>	Anywhere! anywhere!
		Fear I cannot know;
		Anywhere with Jesus
		I can safely go.
</span>

</li><li>	Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
	Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
	Tho’ His hand may lead me over dreariest ways,
	Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

</li><li>	Anywhere with Jesus over land and sea,
	Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
	Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
	Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.

</li><li>	Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
	When the dark’ning  shadows round about me creep;
	Knowing I shall waken never more to roam,
	Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.
<span>	Anywhere! anywhere!
		Fear I cannot know;
		Anywhere with Jesus
		I can safely go.
</span>
