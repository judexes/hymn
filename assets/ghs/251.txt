<li>    	Fading away like the stars of the morning, 
	Losing their light in the glorious sun 
	Thus  would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
	Only remembered by what we have done. 

<span>	Only remembered, Only remembered 
	Only remembered by what we have done; 
	Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling, 
	Only remembered by what we have done.
</span>

</li><li>     	Shall we be missed, tho’ by others succeeded,
	Reaping the fields we in spring time have sown?  
	Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours, 
	Ever remembered by what they have done. 

</li><li>     	Only the truth that in life we have spoken 
	Only the seed that on earth we have sown;
	These shall pass onward when we are forgotten,
	Fruits of the harvest and what we have done.

<span>	Only remembered, Only remembered 
	Only remembered by what we have done; 
	Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling, 
	Only remembered by what we have done.
</span>


</li><li>     	Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels, 
	When the bright crowns of rejoicing are won, 
	Then shall His weary and faithful disciples 
	All be remembered by what they have done. 

</li></ol></div>
