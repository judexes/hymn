</li><li>	Come: and He will give you rest;
	Trust Him; for His word is plain,
	He will take the sinful-est;
	Christ receiveth sinful men.

</li><li>	Now my heart condemns me not,
	Pure before the law I stand;
	He who cleans’d me from all spot
	Satisfied its last demand.

</li><li>	Christ receiveth, sinful men;
	Even me with all my sin;
	Purg’d from ev’ry spot and stain,
	Heav’n with Him I enter in.

		Christ receiv . . eth sinful men; . . . 
		Make the mes . . . sage clear and plain: . . .
		Christ receiv . . . eth sinful men. . . .
