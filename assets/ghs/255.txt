<li>    	They were gather’d in an upper chamber 
	As commanded by the risen Lord, 
	And the promise of the Father 
	There they sought with one accord, 		
	When the Holy Ghost from heav’n 	 descended 
	Like a rushing wind and tongues of fire: 
	So dear Lord, we seek Thy blessing, 
	Come with glory now our hearts inspire. 

<span>	Let the fire fall, Let the fire fall, 
		Let the fire from heaven fall; 
		We are waiting and expecting, 
		Now in faith, dear Lord, we call; 
		Let the fire fall, let the fire fall, 
		On Thy promise we depend; 
		From the glory of Thy presence  
		Let the Pentecostal fire descend.  
</span>
</li><li>    	As Elijah we would raise the altar 
        	For our testimony clear and true, 
        	Christ the Saviour, loving Healer, 
       	Coming Lord, Baptizer too, 
	Ever flowing grace and full salvation, 
	For a ruined race Thy love has plann’d; 
	For this blessed revelation, 
	For Thy written word we dare to stand.

</li><li>     	’Tis the covenanted promise given, 
        	To as many as the Lord shall call, 
       	To the fathers and their children, 
	To Thy people, one and all; 
	So rejoicing in Thy word unfailing, 
	We draw nigh in faith Thy power to know 
	Come, o come, Thou burning Spirit, 
	Set our hearts with heav’nly fire aglow.
<span>	Let the fire fall, Let the fire fall, 
		Let the fire from heaven fall; 
		We are waiting and expecting, 
		Now in faith, dear Lord, we call; 
		Let the fire fall, let the fire fall, 
		On Thy promise we depend; 
		From the glory of Thy presence  
		Let the Pentecostal fire descend.  
</span>

</li><li> 	With a living coal from off the altar
	Touch our lips to swell Thy wondrous praise,
	To extol Thee, bless, adore Thee,
	And our songs of worship raise;
	Let the cloud of glory now descending
	Fill our hearts with holy ecstacy,
	Come in all Thy glorious fulness,
	Blessed Holy Spirit, have Thy way.
