<li>	“Called unto holiness,” Church of our God,
	Purchased of Jesus, redeemed by His blood;
	Called from the world and its idols to flee,
	Called from the bondage of sin to be free.

<span>	“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our 
		  watchword and song,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re 			   	  marching along:
		Sing. . . it, shout it, loud . . .and long,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.
</span>

</li><li>	“Called unto holiness,” children of Light,
	Walking with Jesus in garments of white;
	Raiment unsullied, nor tarnished with sin,
	God’s Holy Spirit abiding within.

</li><li>	“Called unto holiness,” praise His dear name,
	This blessed secret to faith now made plain,
	Not our own righteousness, but Christ within,
	Living and reigning, and saving from sin.
<span>	“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our 
		  watchword and song,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re 			   	  marching along:
		Sing. . . it, shout it, loud . . .and long,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.

</li><li>	“Called unto holiness,” glorious thought!
	Up from the wilderness wanderings brought
	Out from the shadows and darkness of night
	Into the Canaan of perfect delight.
</li><li>	“Called unto holiness,” Bride of the Lamb,
	Waiting the Bridegroom’s returning again;
	Lift up your heads, for the day draweth near.
	When in His beauty the King shall appear.

<span>	“Holiness unto the Lord,” is our 
		  watchword and song,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” as we’re 			   	  marching along:
		Sing. . . it, shout it, loud . . .and long,
		“Holiness unto the Lord,” now and for ever.
