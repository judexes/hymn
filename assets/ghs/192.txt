<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>192</h4><h4 class="hymn-title">	O FOR A HEART TO PRAISE MY GOD</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O for a heart to praise my God,
	A heart from sin set free,
	A heart that always feels Thy  blood
	So freely spilt for me.

</li><li>	A  heart resigned, submissive, meek,
	My great Redeemer’s throne,
	Where only Christ is heard to speak,
	Where Jesus reigns alone.

</li><li>	A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
	Believing, true, and clean;
	Which neither life nor death can part
	From Him that dwells within.

</li><li>	A heart in every thought  renewed,
	And full of love divine;
	Perfect, and right, and  pure, and good,
	A copy, Lord, of Thine.

</li><li>	Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
	Come quickly from above,
	Write Thy new name upon my heart,
	Thy new, best name of love.  Amen.
