<li>	It may be at morn, when the  day is awaking,
	When sunlight thro’ darkness  and shadow is breaking,
	That Jesus will come in the fulness of glory,
	To receive from the world “His own.”

<span>	O Lord Jesus, how long, how long,
		Ere we shout the glad song,
		Christ returneth!
		Hallelujah! hallelujah! Amen,
		Hallelujah! Amen.
</span>

</li><li>	It may be at mid-day, it may be at twilight,
	It may be, per chance, that the blackness of midnight
	Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
	When Jesus receives “His own.”

</li><li>	While its hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,
	With glorified saints and the angels attending,
	With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,
	Will Jesus receive “His own.” 
<span>	O Lord Jesus, how long, how long,
		Ere we shout the glad song,
		Christ returneth!
		Hallelujah! hallelujah! Amen,
		Hallelujah! Amen.
</span>


</li><li>	Oh, joy! oh, delight! should we go without dying,
	No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying,
	Caught up thro’ the clouds with our Lord into glory,
	When Jesus receives “His own.”
