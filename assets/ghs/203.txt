<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>203 </h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>THERE IS NO LOVE LIKE THE LOVE OF JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There is no love like the love of Jesus -
	Never to fade or fall,
	Till into the fold of the peace of God
	He has gather’d us all.

<span>	Jesus’ love, precious love,
		Boundless and pure and free;
		Oh, turn to that love, weary wand’ring soul:
		Jesus pleadeth with thee!
</span>

</li><li>	There is no eye like the eye of Jesus,
	Piercing so far away;
	Ne’er out of the sight of its tender light
	Can the wanderer stray.

</li><li>	There is no voice like the voice of Jesus.
	Tender and sweet its chime,
	Like musical ring of a flowing spring,
	In the bright summer time.
<span>	Jesus’ love, precious love,
		Boundless and pure and free;
		Oh, turn to that love, weary wand’ring soul:
		Jesus pleadeth with thee!
</span>


</li><li>	There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
	Filled with a tender love:
	No throb nor throe that our hearts can know,
	But He feels it above.
