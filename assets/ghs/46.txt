<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>46</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	A  CHRISTIAN  HOME</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O give us homes built firm upon the Saviour,
	Where Christ is Head and Counsellor and Guide;
	Where ev’ry child is taught His love and favour,
	And gives his heart to Christ, the Crucified:
	How sweet to know that tho’ his foot-steps waver,
	His faithful Lord is walking by his side!

</li><li>	O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers,
	Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
	Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
	Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
	A home where each finds joy in serving others,
	And love still shines, tho’ days be dark and grim.

</li><li>	O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,
	The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
	Where pray’r comes first in peace or in disaster,
	And praise is natural speech to ev’ry tongue;
	Where mountains move before a faith that’s vaster,
	And Christ sufficient is for old and young.

</li><li>	O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!
	We trust to Thee their problems, toil, and care;
	Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
	If Thou art always Lord and Master there:
	Be Thou the center of our least endeavour _
	Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.
