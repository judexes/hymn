<li>	“There shall be showers of blessing:”
	This is the promise of love;
	There shall be seasons refreshing,
	Sent from the Saviour above.

<span>	Showers of blessing, 
		Showers of blessing we need;
		Mercy drops round us are falling,
		But for the showers we plead.
</span>

</li><li>	“There shall be showers of blessing:”
	Precious reviving again;
	Over the hills and the valleys,
	Sound of abundance of rain.

</li><li>	“There shall be showers of blessing:”
	Send them upon us, O Lord!
	Grant to us now a refreshing;
	Come, and now honour Thy Word.
<span>	Showers of blessing, 
		Showers of blessing we need;
		Mercy drops round us are falling,
		But for the showers we plead.
</span>


</li><li>	“There shall be showers of blessing:”
	Oh, that today they might fall,
	Now, as to God we’re confessing,
	Now as on Jesus we call!

</li><li>	“There shall be showers of blessing:”
	If we but trust and obey;
	There shall be seasons refreshing,
	If we let God have His way.
