<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>166</h4><h4 class="hymn-title">	DID YOU THINK TO PRAY?

<li>	Ere you left your room this morning
	Did you think to pray?
	In the name of Christ, our Saviour,
	Did you sue for loving favour,
	As a shield today?

<span>		
		O how praying rests the weary!
		Prayer will change the night to day,
		So, when life seems dark and dreary,
		Don’t forget to pray.
</span>

</li><li>	When you met with great temptation
	Did you think to pray?
	By His dying love and merit
	Did you claim the Holy Spirit
	As your guide and stay?

</li><li>	When your heart was overburdened
	Did you think to pray?
	Did you plead for grace, my brother,
	That you might forgive another
	Who had crossed your way?
<span>		
		O how praying rests the weary!
		Prayer will change the night to day,
		So, when life seems dark and dreary,
		Don’t forget to pray.
</span>


</li><li>	When sore trials came upon you
	Did you think to pray?
	When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
	Balm of Gilead did you borrow
	At the gates today?
