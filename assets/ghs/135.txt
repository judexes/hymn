<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>135</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>TELL ME THE OLD, OLD STORY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Tell  me the old, old story,
	Of unseen things above,
	Of Jesus and His glory,
	Of Jesus and His love;
	Tell me the story simply,
	As to a little child,
	For I am weak and weary,
	And helpless and defiled.

<span>	Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Of Jesus and His love.
</span>

</li><li>	Tell me the story slowly,
	That I may take it in-
	That wonderful redemption,
	God’s remedy for sin;
	Tell me the story often,
	For I forget so soon,
	The “early dew” of morning
	Has passed away at noon.

</li><li>	Tell me the story softly,
	With earnest tones, and grave;
	Remember I’m the sinner
	Whom Jesus came to save;
	Tell me the story always,
	If you would really be,
	In any time of trouble,
	A comforter to me.
<span>	Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Of Jesus and His love.
</span>


</li><li>	Tell me the same old story,
	When you have cause to fear
	That this world’s empty glory
	Is costing me too dear;
	Yes, and when that world’s glory
	Is dawning on my soul,
	Tell me the old, old story:
	“Christ Jesus makes thee whole.”

<span>	Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Tell me the Old, Old Story,
		Of Jesus and His love.
