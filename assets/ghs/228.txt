<li>	O do not let the word depart, 
	And close thine eyes against the light;
	Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
	Be saved, O tonight

<span>	O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
		Wilt thou be saved?  
		Then why not to-night?
</span>

</li><li>	Tomorrow’s sun may never rise, 
	To bless thy long deluded sight;
	This is the time, O then be wise,
	Be saved, O tonight.

</li><li>	Our Lord in pity lingers still,
	And with thou thus His love requite?
	Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
	Be saved, O tonight.
<span>	O why not to-night? O why not to-night?
		Wilt thou be saved?  
		Then why not to-night?
</span>


</li><li>	Our blessed Lord refuses none
	Who would to Him their souls unite;
	Believe, obey, the work is done,
	Be saved, O tonight.
