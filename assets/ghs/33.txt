<li>	What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
	Since Jesus came into my heart;
	I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
	Since Jesus came into my heart.

<span>	Since Jesus came into my heart,
		Since Jesus came into my heart;
		Floods of joy o’er my soul
		Like the sea billows roll,
		Since Jesus came into my heart.
</span>

</li><li>	I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
	Since Jesus came into my heart;
	And my sins which were many are all washed away,
	Since Jesus came into my heart.

</li><li>	I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
	Since Jesus came into my heart;
	And I’m happy, so happy as onward I go,
	Since Jesus came into my heart.

<span>	Since Jesus came into my heart,
		Since Jesus came into my heart;
		Floods of joy o’er my soul
		Like the sea billows roll,
		Since Jesus came into my heart.
