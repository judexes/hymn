<li>	“Great is Thy faithfulness,” O God my Father!
	There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
	Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not,
	As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

<span>	“Great is Thy faithfulness!
		Great is Thy faithfulness!”
		Morning by morning new mercies I see;
		All I have needed Thy hand hath provided - 
		“Great is Thy faithfulness,” Lord, unto me!
</span>

</li><li>	Summer and winter, and spring time and harvest,
	Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
	Join with all nature in manifold witness,
	To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

</li><li>	Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
	Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
	Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
	Blessings all mine, with ten thousands beside!

		Great is Thy faithfulness!”
		Morning by morning new mercies I see;
		All I have needed Thy hand hath provided - 
		“Great is Thy faithfulness,” Lord, unto me!
