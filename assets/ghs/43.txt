<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>43</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	TRUST  AND  OBEY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	When we walk with the Lord,
	In the light of His word,
	What a glory He sheds on our way!
	While we do His good will,
	He abides with us still,
	And with all who will trust and obey.

<span>	Trust and obey!
		For there’s no other way
		To be happy in Jesus,
		But to trust and obey.
</span>

</li><li>	Not a shadow can rise,
	Not a cloud in the skies,
	But His smile quickly drives it away;
	Not a doubt nor a fear,
	Not a sigh nor a tear,
	Can abide while we trust and obey.

</li><li>	Not a burden we bear,
	Not a sorrow we share,
	But our toil He doth richly repay;
	Not a grief nor a loss,
	Not a frown nor a cross,
	But is blest if we trust and obey.

</li><li>	But we never can prove
	The delights of His love,
	Until all on the altar we lay;
	For the favour He shows,
	And the joy He bestows
	Are for them who will trust and obey.

</li><li>	Then in fellowship sweet
	We will sit at His feet,
	Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
	What He says we will do,
	Where He sends we will go,
	Never fear, only trust and obey.
<span>	Trust and obey!
		For there’s no other way
		To be happy in Jesus,
		But to trust and obey.
