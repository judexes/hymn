	Let them take the blessed light
	Into every land of darkness,
	Piercing through the shades of night.

	Over mountain, over wave,
	Telling everywhere of Jesus,
	And His mighty power to save.

</li><li>	While we pray for other nations,
	Send them help with willing hand,
	Let us not forget the home fields -
	Jesus for our native land!
