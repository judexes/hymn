<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>111</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>RESCUE  THE  PERISHING</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Rescue the perishing, Care for the dying,
	Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
	Weep o’er the erring one, Lift up the fallen,
	Tell them of Jesus, the Mighty to save.

		Rescue the perishing,
		Care for the dying;
		Jesus is merciful,
		Jesus will save.

</li><li>	Though they are slighting Him, Still He is waiting,
	Waiting the penitent child to receive.
	Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently,
	He will forgive if they only believe.

</li><li>	Down in the human heart, Crushed by the tempter,
	Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
	Touched by a loving hand, Wakened by kindness,
	Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

</li><li>	Rescue the perishing, Duty demands it; 
	Strength for thy labour the Lord will provide;
	Back to the narrow way Patiently win them; 
	Tell the poor wanderer a  Saviour has died.
