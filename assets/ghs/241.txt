  I’VE FOUND THE “PEARL OF GREATESTPRICE”</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I’ve found the “Pearl of greatest price,”
	My heart doth sing of joy,
	And sing I must, for Christ I have
	Oh, what a Christ have I!

</li><li>	My Christ, He is “the Lord of lords,”
	The Sovereign “King of kings,”
	The risen “Sun of Righteousness,
	With healing in His wings.”

</li><li>	My Christ, He is “the Tree of Life,”
	That in God’s Eden grows;
	The living “clear as crystal” stream
	Whence life for ever flows.

</li><li>	Christ is my Meat, Christ is my Drink,
	My Medicine, and my Health;
	My Portion, mine Inheritance,	
	Yea, all my boundless Wealth.
