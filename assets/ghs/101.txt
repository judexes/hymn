<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>101</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>MY FATHER KNOWS

<li>	He knows the bitter, weary way,
	The endless striving day by day,
	The souls that weep, the souls that pray;
	My Father knows, my Father knows.

</li><li>	He knows  when faint and worn we sink,
	How deep the pain, how near the brink
	Of dark despair we pause and shrink;
	My Father knows, my Father knows

</li><li>	He knows how hard the fight  has been,
	The clouds that come our lives between, 
	The wounds the world has never seen; 
	My Father knows, my Father  knows.

</li><li>	He knows! O heart, take up thy cross,
	And know earth’s treasures are but dross,
	And all will prove as gain, not loss;
	My Father knows, my Father knows. 	</li></ol></div>
