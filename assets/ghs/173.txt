<li>	Jesus may come today, Glad day! Glad day!
	And I would see my Friend;
	Dangers and troubles would end
	If Jesus should come today.

<span>	Glad day! Glad day!
		Is it the crowning day?
		I’ll live for today, nor anxious be,
		Jesus, my Lord, I soon shall see;
		Glad day! Glad day!
		Is it the crowning day?
</span>

</li><li>	I may go home today, Glad day! Glad day!
	Seemeth I hear their song;
	Hail to the radiant throng!
	If I should go home today.

</li><li>	Why should I anxious be? Glad day! Glad day!
	Lights appear on the shore,
	Storms will affright nevermore,
	For He is ‘‘at hand” today.
<span>	Glad day! Glad day!
		Is it the crowning day?
		I’ll live for today, nor anxious be,
		Jesus, my Lord, I soon shall see;
		Glad day! Glad day!
		Is it the crowning day?
</span>


</li><li>	Faithful I’ll be today, Glad day! Glad day!
	And I will freely tell
	Why I should love Him so well,
	For He is my all today.
