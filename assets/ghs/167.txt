	In my distress He kindly will help me;
	He ever loves and cares for His own.

	One who can help my burdens to bear;
	I must tell Jesus, I must tell Jesus;
	He all my cares and sorrows will share.

</li><li>	O how the world to evil allures me!
	O how my heart is tempted to sin!
	I must tell Jesus, and He will help me
	Over the world the vict’ry to win.
