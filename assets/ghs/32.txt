<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>32</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	HEAVEN CAME DOWN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O what a wonderful, wonderful day -
	Day I will never forget;
	After I’d wandered in darkness away,
	Jesus my Saviour I met.
	O what a tender, compassionate Friend! 
	He met the need of my heart;
	Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
	He made all the darkness depart!

<span>	Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
		When at the cross the Saviour made me whole;
		My sins were washed away
		And my night was turned to day!
		Heaven came down and glory filled my soul !
</span>

</li><li>	Born of the Spirit with life from above
	Into God’s fam’ly divine,
	Justified fully thru Calvary’s love,
	O what a standing is mine!
	And the transaction so quickly was made
	When as a sinner I came,
	Took of the offer of grace He did proffer - 
	He saved me, O praise His dear name.

</li><li>	Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure
	After the passing of time;
	I have a future in heaven for sure,
	There in those mansions sublime.
	And it’s because of that wonderful day
	When at the cross I believed;
	Riches eternal and blessings supernal
	From His precious hand I received.

<span>	Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
		When at the cross the Saviour made me whole;
		My sins were washed away
		And my night was turned to day!
		Heaven came down and glory filled my soul !
</span>
