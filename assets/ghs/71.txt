<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>71</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	I WANT TO SEE JESUS, DON’T YOU?</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There is One loved me so that for me He died,
	He’s my dear, precious Saviour so true;
	On the cross for my sins He was crucified;
	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

<span>	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?
		My Saviour so faithful and true;...
		When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
		O I want to see Jesus, don’t you?...
</span>

</li><li>	When I’m weary and faint He is always near,
	With His joy He my strength doth renew;
	And He comforts my heart, speaking words of cheer:
	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

</li><li>	Holy angels keep watch  o’er me thro’ the night,
	And each morning He guards me anew;
	In the smile of His love doth my soul delight;
	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

</li><li>	He is fairer than lily or rose to me,
	And His blessings fall soft as the dew;
	O my heart, how it longs His dear face to see:
	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?
</li><li>	There’s a place for my soul that He doth prepare,
	And its beauty by faith I can view;
	First of all, when I enter that mansion fair,
	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?

<span>	I want to see Jesus, don’t you?
		My Saviour so faithful and true;...
		When I reach the strand of that love-bright land,
		O I want to see Jesus, don’t you?...
</span>
