<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>126</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>GREAT GOD OF WONDERS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Great God of wonders! all Thy ways
	Display the attributes divine;
	But countless acts of pard’ning grace
	Beyond Thine other wonders shine:
		<span>Who is a pard’ning God like Thee?
		Or who has grace so rich and free?
</span>

</li><li>	In wonder lost, with trembling joy
	We take the pardon of our God:
	Pardon for crimes of deepest dye,
	A pardon bought with Jesus blood.
<span>	Who is a pard’ning God like Thee?
		Or who has grace so rich and free?
</span>


</li><li>	Pardon - from an offended God!
	Pardon - for sins of deepest dye!
	Pardon - bestowed through Jesus’ blood!
	Pardon - that brings the rebel nigh!
<span>	Who is a pard’ning God like Thee?
		Or who has grace so rich and free?
</span>

</li><li>	O may this strange, this matchless grace,
	This God-like miracle of love,
	Fill the wide earth with grateful praise,
	As now it fills the choirs above!
<span>	Who is a pard’ning God like Thee?
		Or who has grace so rich and free?

</span>
