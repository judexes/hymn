<li>	Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
	Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
	Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
	God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!
</li><li>	Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,
	Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
	Cherubim and seraphim falling down before Thee,
	Who wert and art, and evermore shalt be.

</li><li>	Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
	Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,
	Only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
	Perfect in power, in love, and purity.

</li><li>	Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!
	All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth, 		   and sky, and sea!
	Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty!
	God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!
