<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>41</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>  ONWARD,  CHRISTIAN  SOLDIERS!</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Onward, Christian Soldiers!
	Marching as to war,
	Looking unto Jesus,
	Who is gone before;
	Christ, the Royal Master,
	Leads against the foe;
	Forward into battle,
	See His banners go.
<span>	Onward, Christian Soldiers!
		Marching as to war,
		Looking unto Jesus,
		Who is gone before. 
</span>

</li><li>	At the name of Jesus
	Satan’s host doth flee;
	On then, Christian soldiers,
	On to victory!
	Hell’s foundations quiver
	At the shout of praise:
	Brothers, lift your voices,
	Loud your anthems raise. 

</li><li>	Like a mighty army
	Moves the church of God:
	Brothers, we are treading
	Where the saints have trod
	We are not divided,
	All one body we - 
	One in hope and doctrine,
	One in charity.

</li><li>	Crowns and thrones may perish,
	Kingdoms rise and wane;
	But the church of Jesus
	Constant will remain:
	Gates of hell can never 
	‘Gainst that church prevail;
	
	We have Christ’s own promise -
	And that cannot fail.

</li><li>	Onward then, ye people,
	Join our happy throng;
	Blend with ours your voices
	In the triumph song:
	“Glory, praise and honour,
	Unto Christ the King,” _
	This, through countless ages,
	Men and angels sing.

<span>	Onward, Christian Soldiers!
		Marching as to war,
		Looking unto Jesus,
		Who is gone before.
