<li>    	Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet, 
	Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet; 
	Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,
	Lower and lower; be Thou all in all. 

<span>		Lower and  lower, down at Thy cross,
		All the world’s treasure counting but dross;                
		Down at Thy feet, blessed Saviour we fall, 
		Lower, still lower, Christ all in all.
</span>

</li><li>   	Lower and lower, dear Saviour, we pray, 
	Losing the self life still more ev’ry day;
	Weak and unworthy, we’re looking above;
	Empty us, Jesus; then fill us with love.

</li><li>   	Lower and lower; yet higher we rise,
	Lifted in Jesus, led on to the skies;
	Humbly we follow the way of the cross
	Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.
<span>		Lower and  lower, down at Thy cross,
		All the world’s treasure counting but dross;                
		Down at Thy feet, blessed Saviour we fall, 
		Lower, still lower, Christ all in all.
</span>
