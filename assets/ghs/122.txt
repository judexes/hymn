<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>122</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>SOMEBODY NEEDS YOUR LOVE

<li>	Out in the darkness of sorrow and sin,
	Somebody needs your love;
	Led by the Master, that soul you may win,
	Somebody needs your love.

<span>	Somebody needs your love,
		Somebody needs your love,...
		Someone in sadness,
		Yearning for gladness,
		Somebody needs your love.
</span>
</li><li>	Many are helpless, and wait for your call,
	Somebody needs your love;
	Show them that Jesus is all and in all,
	Somebody needs your love.

</li><li>	Some one is tempted to turn from the right,
	Somebody needs your love;
	Longing for courage and strength for the fight,
	Somebody needs your love.

</li><li>	Some are down-hearted, in sorrow they  roam,
	Somebody needs your love;
	Many are sighing for heaven and home,
	Somebody needs your love.

		                                         
<span>	Somebody needs your love,
		Somebody needs your love,...
		Someone in sadness,
		Yearning for gladness,
		Somebody needs your love.
