<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>27</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	I  AM  BOUND  FOR  CANAAN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Storms do not alarm me,
	They sometime must cease,
	Trials cannot harm me,
	For I have blessed peace;
	All I’ve left behind me,
	I long for no more,
	Better things shall find me
	On Canaan’s shore.

<span>	Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
		I am bound for Canaan,
		Where milk and honey flowing,
		Shall ev’ry need supply;
		All battles fought and 
		The vict’ry won,
		Peace and joy my portion,
		My soul shall rest,
		On its shore by and by.
</span>

</li><li>	Troubles do not fret me,
	They cannot abide,
	Tho’ they may beset me,
	In Jesus, I will hide;
	All the world’s commotion
	About me may roar,
	There’s no stormy ocean
	On Canaan’s shore.

</li><li>	I in grace abiding,
	Am trying to stay,
	In the shadow hiding
	Of Canaan’s perfect day;
	All I trust may fail me,
	’Twill matter no more,
	Nothing can assail me
	On Canaan’s shore.

<span>	Let those who will stay in Egypt land,
		I am bound for Canaan,
		Where milk and honey flowing,
		Shall ev’ry need supply;
		All battles fought and 
		The vict’ry won,
		Peace and joy my portion,
		My soul shall rest,
		On its shore by and by.
