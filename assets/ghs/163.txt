<li>	My God, is any hour so sweet,
	From blush of morn to evening star,
	As that which calls me to Thy feet,
	The hour of prayer?.

</li><li>	Blest be that tranquil hour of morn,
	And blest that hour of solemn eve,
	When, on the wings of prayer upborne,
	The world I leave.

</li><li>	For then a day-spring shines on me,
	Brighter than morn’s ethereal glow;
	And richer dews descend from Thee
	Than earth can know.

</li><li>	Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
	Then are my sins by Thee forgiven;
	Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
	With hope of heaven.

</li><li>	No word can tell what blest relief,
	There for my every want I find;
	What strength for warfare, balm for grief;
	What peace of mind.
</li><li>	Hushed is each doubt, gone every fear;
	My spirit seems in heaven to stay;
	And even the penitential tear
	Is wiped away.

</li><li>	Lord, till I reach Your blissful shore,
	No privilege so dear shall be,
	As thus my inmost soul to pour
	In prayer to Thee.
