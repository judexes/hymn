<li>	Once again the Gospel message,
	From the Saviour you have heard;
	Will you heed the invitation?
	Will you turn and seek the Lord?

<span>	Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!...
		Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!
</span>

</li><li>	Many summers you have wasted,
	Ripen’d harvests you have seen;
	Winter snows by Spring have melted:
	Yet you linger in your sin.

</li><li>	Jesus for your choice is waiting;
	Tarry not: at once decide!
	While the Spirit now is striving,
	Yield, and seek the Saviour’s side.

<span>	Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!...
		Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!
</span>


</li><li>	Cease of fitness to be thinking;
	Do not longer try to feel !
	It is trusting, and not feeling, 
	That will give the Spirit’s seal.

</li><li>	Let your will to God be given,
	Trust in Christ’s atoning blood;
	Look to Jesus now in heaven,
	Rest on His unchanging word.


<span>	Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!...
		Come believing! come believing!
		Come to Jesus! look and live!
</span>
