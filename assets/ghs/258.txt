<li>	Oh to be like Thee! Blessed Redeemer, 
	This is my constant longing and prayer
	Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures, 
	Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

<span>		Oh, to be like Thee! Oh, to be like Thee! 
		Blessed Redeemer pure as Thou art!
		Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness; 
		Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
</span>

</li><li>	Oh, to be like Thee! full of compassion, 
	Loving forgiving, tender and kind, 
	Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting, 
	Seeking the wandering sinner to find.

</li><li>	Oh, to be like Thee! lowly in spirit, 
	Holy and harmless, patient and brave; 
	Meekly enduring cruel reproaches, 
	Willing to suffer others to save.
<span>		Oh, to be like Thee! Oh, to be like Thee! 
		Blessed Redeemer pure as Thou art!
		Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness; 
		Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
</span>

</li><li>	Oh, to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming, 
	Now to receive th’anointing divine, 
	All that I am and have I am bringing, 
	Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

</li><li>	Oh, to be like Thee! while I am pleading, 
	Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love, 
	Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling, 
	Fit me for life and heaven above.
<span>		Oh, to be like Thee! Oh, to be like Thee! 
		Blessed Redeemer pure as Thou art!
		Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness; 
		Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.
