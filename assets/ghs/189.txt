<li>	Take time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;
	Abide in Him always, and feed on His Word;
	Make friends of God’s children help those who are weak;
	Forgetting in nothing, His blessing to seek.

</li><li>	Take time to be holy, the world rushes on;
	Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone-
	
	By looking to Jesus, like him thou shalt be;
	Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

</li><li>	Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide;
	And run not before Him, whatever betide;
	In joy or  in sorrow still follow thy Lord,
	And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His word.

</li><li>	Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul;
	Each thought and each temper beneath His control:
	Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
	Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
