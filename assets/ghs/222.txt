 SPEED THY SERVANTS, SAVIOUR, SPEED THEM</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them;
	Thou art Lord of winds and waves;
	They were bound, but Thou hast freed them,
	Now they go to free the slaves.
	Be Thou with them,
	’Tis Thine arm alone that saves.

</li><li>	Friends, and home, and all forsaking,
	Lord, they go at Thy command;
	As their stay Thy promise taking,
	While they traverse sea and land:
	O, be with them,
	Lead them safely by the hand!

</li><li>	When no fruit appears to cheer them,
	And they seem to toil in vain,
	Then in mercy, Lord, draw near them,
	Then their sinking hopes sustain;
	Thus supported,
	Let their zeal revive again.
</li><li>	In the midst of opposition,
	Let them trust, O Lord, in Thee:
	When success attends their mission,
	Let Thy servants humble be;
	Never leave them,
	Till Thy face in heaven they see:

</li><li>	There to reap in joy for ever
	Fruit that grows from seed here sown,
	There to be with Him, who never
	Ceases to preserve His own,
	And with gladness
	Give the praise to Him alone.
