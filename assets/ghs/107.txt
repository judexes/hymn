	’Till the Lord shall come again.

		Go and tell them, go and tell them,
		He is coming, He is coming,
		He is coming back again.

</li><li>	’Tis the church’s great commission,
	’Tis the Master’s last command;
	Christ has died for every creature,
	Tell it out in every land.

</li><li>	Christ is gathering out a people,
	To His name from every race;
	Haste to give the invitation
	Ere shall end the day of grace.

</li><li>	Give the  gospel as a witness,
	To a world of sinful men;
	

	Till the Bride shall be completed,
	And the Lord shall come again.

		Jesus died for sinful men.
		Go and tell them, go and tell them,
		He is coming, He is coming,
		He is coming back again.
