	In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
	O how our hearts beat high with joy
	Whene’er we hear that glorious word!
	Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
	We will be true to Thee till death.

</li><li>	Faith of our fathers! we will strive
	To win all nations unto Thee,
	And through the truth that comes from God
	Mankind shall then be truly free;
	Faith  of our fathers, holy faith!
	We will be true to Thee till death.

</li><li>	Faith of our fathers! we will love
	Both friend and foe in all our strife,
	And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
	By kindly words and virtuous life;
	Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
	We will be true to Thee till death.
