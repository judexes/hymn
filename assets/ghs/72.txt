<li>	My hope is built on nothing less,
	Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness,
	I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
	But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

<span>	On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
		All other ground is sinking sand,
		All other ground is sinking sand.
</span>

</li><li>	When darkness seems to hide His face,
	I rest on His unchanging grace;
	In every high and stormy gale,
	My anchor holds within the vale.

</li><li>	His oath, His covenant, His blood,
	Support me in the whelming flood;
	When all around my soul gives way,
	He then is all my hope and stay.

</li><li>	When He shall come with trumpet sound,
	Oh, may I then in Him be found;
	Dressed in His righteousness alone,
	Faultless to stand before the throne.

<span>	On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
		All other ground is sinking sand,
		All other ground is sinking sand.
</span>
