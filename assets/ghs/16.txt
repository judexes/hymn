<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>16</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	IF GOD BE FOR US</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Rejoice in the Lord! oh, let His mercy cheer;
	He sunders the bands that enthrall;
	Redeem’d by His blood why should we ever fear
	Since Jesus is our “all in all”?

	<span>“If God be for us, if God be for us,
		If God be for us, who can be against us?
		Who? Who? Who?
		Who can be against us, against us?”
</span>

</li><li>	Be strong in the Lord ! rejoicing in His might,
	Be loyal and true day by day;
	When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
	And He will be our strength and stay.

</li><li>	Confide in His word - His promises so sure;
	In Christ they are “ yea and amen;”
	Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
	’Tis written o’er and o’er again.

</li><li>	Abide in the Lord: secure in His control,
	’Tis life everlasting begun;
	To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul -
	It never, never can be done!

	<span>“If God be for us, if God be for us,
		If God be for us, who can be against us?
		Who? Who? Who?
		Who can be against us, against us?”
