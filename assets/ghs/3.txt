<li>	Impatient heart, be still !
	What tho’ He tarries long?
	What tho’ the triumph song
 	Is still delay’d?
	Thou hast His promise sure,
	And that is all secure;
	Be not afraid! Be not afraid!
		<span>Be still ! ... be still !
		Impatient heart ... be still !</span>

</li><li>	My eager heart, be still!
	Thy Lord will surely come,
	And take thee to His home,
	With Him  to dwell;
	It may not be today;
	And yet, my soul, it may;
	I cannot tell, I cannot tell.
<span>	Be still ! ... be still !
		My eager heart ... be still !
</span>

</li><li>	My anxious heart, be still!
	Watch, work, and pray, and then
	It will not matter when
	Thy Lord  shall come;
	At midnight, or at noon;
	He cannot come too soon
	To take thee home, To take thee home.
<span>
		Be still  ! ... be still  !
		My anxious heart ... be still !
