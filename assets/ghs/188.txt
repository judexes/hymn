<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>188</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>O LORD, HOW HAPPY SHOULD WE BE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O Lord, how happy should we be
	If we could cast our care on Thee,
	If we from self could rest,
	And feel at heart that One above,
	In perfect wisdom, perfect love
	Is working for the best.

</li><li>	How far from this our daily life,
	Ever disturbed by anxious strife,
	By sudden wild alarms.
	O could we but relinquish all 
	Our earthly props, and simply fall
	On Thine almighty arms.

</li><li>	Could we but kneel and cast our load,
	E’en while we pray, upon our God,
	Then rise with lightened cheer,
	Sure that the Father, who is nigh
	To still the famished raven’s cry,
	Will hear, in that we fear.

</li><li>	Lord, make these faithless hearts of ours
	Thy lessons learn from birds and flowers:
	Make them from self to cease,
	Leave all things to a Father’s will,
	And taste, before Him lying still,
	E’en in affliction, peace.
