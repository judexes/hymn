<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>127</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>ROCK  OF AGES  CLEFT FOR ME</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
	Let me hide myself in Thee!
	Let the water and the blood,
	From Thy riven side which flowed,
	Be of sin the double cure;
	Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

</li><li>	Not the labours of my hands,
	Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
	Could my zeal no respite know,
	Could my tears for ever flow,
	All for sin could not atone;
	Thou must save and Thou alone.

</li><li>	Nothing in my hand I bring,
	Simply to Thy cross I cling;
	Naked, come to Thee for dress;
	Helpless, look to Thee for grace:
	Foul, I to the fountain fly;
	Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

</li><li>	While I draw this fleeting breath,
	When my eyelids close in death,
	When I soar to worlds unknown,
	See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
	Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
	Let me hide myself in Thee.
