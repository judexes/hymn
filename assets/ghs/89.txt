<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>89</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	 O JESUS, I HAVE PROMISED</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O Jesus, I have promised
	To serve Thee to the end;
	Be Thou for ever near me,
	My Master and my Friend:
	I shall not fear the battle
	If Thou art by my side,
	Nor wander from the pathway
	If Thou wilt be my Guide.	

</li><li>	O let me feel Thee near me;
	The world is ever near;
	I see the sights that dazzle,
	The tempting sounds I hear;
	My foes are ever near me,
	Around me and within;
	But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
	And shield my soul from sin.

</li><li>	O let me hear Thee speaking
	In accents clear and still,
	Above the storms of passion,
	The murmurs of self-will;
	O speak to reassure me,
	To hasten or control;
	O speak and make me listen,
	Thou Guardian of my soul.

</li><li>	O Jesus, Thou hast promised
	To all who follow Thee,
	That where Thou art in glory
	There shall Thy servant be;
	And, Jesus, I have promised
	To serve Thee to the end;
	O give me grace to follow 
	My Master and my Friend.
