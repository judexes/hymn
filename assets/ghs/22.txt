<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>22	</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>SIMPLY TRUSTING EVERYDAY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Simply trusting ev’ry day,
	Trusting through a stormy way;
	Even when my faith is small,
	Trusting Jesus, that is all. 

<span>	Trusting as the moments fly,
		Trusting as the days go by;
		Trusting Him whate’er befall,
		Trusting Jesus, that is all.
</span>

</li><li>	Brightly doth His Spirit shine
	Into this poor heart of mine;
	While He leads I cannot fall;
	Trusting Jesus, that is all.

</li><li>	Singing if my way be clear;
	Praying if the path be drear;
	If in danger, for Him call;
	Trusting Jesus, that is all.

</li><li>	Trusting Him while life shall last,
	Trusting Him till earth be past;
	Till within the jasper wall:
	Trusting Jesus, that is all.

<span>	Trusting as the moments fly,
		Trusting as the days go by;
		Trusting Him whate’er befall,
		Trusting Jesus, that is all.
