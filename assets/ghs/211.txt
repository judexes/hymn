<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>211</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>CROWN HIM WITH MANY CROWNS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Crown Him with many crowns,
	The Lamb upon His Throne;
	Hark! how the heav’nly anthem drowns
	All music but its own:	
	Awake, my soul, and sing
	Of Him who died for thee;
	And hail Him as thy matchless King
	Through all eternity.

</li><li>	Crown Him the Virgin’s Son,
	The God incarnate born,
	Whose arm those crimson trophies won
	Which now His brow adorn;
	Fruit of the mystic Rose,
	As of that Rose the Stem;
	The Root whence mercy ever flows,
	The Babe of Bethlehem.

</li><li>	Crown Him the Lord of love:
	Behold His hands and side,
	Those wounds yet visible above
	In beauty glorified:
	No angel in the sky
	Can fully bear that sight,
	But downward bends His burning eye
	At mysteries so bright.

</li><li>	Crown Him the Lord of life,
	Who triumphed o’er the grave,
	And rose victorious in the strife
	For those He came to save:
	His glories now we sing,
	Who died, and rose on high;
	Who died, eternal life to bring,
	And lives, that death may die.

</li><li>	Crown Him the Lord of peace,
	Whose power a sceptre sways
	From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
	And all be prayer and praise:
	His reign shall know no end,
	And round His pierced feet
	Fair flowers of Paradise extend
	Their fragrance ever sweet.

</li><li>	Crown Him the Lord of years,
	The Potentate of time,
	Creator of the rolling spheres,
	Ineffably sublime:
	All hail, Redeemer, hail !
	For Thou hast died for me;
	Thy praise shall never, never fail
	Throughout eternity.
