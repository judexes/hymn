<li>	The thing my God doth hate 
	That I no more may do,
	Thy creature, Lord, again create,
	And all my soul renew.		
</li><li>	My  soul  shall then, like Thine,
	Abhor the thing unclean,
	
	And,  sanctified  by love divine,
	For ever cease from sin.

</li><li>	That blessed law of Thine,
	Jesus, to me impart;
	The Spirit’s law of life divine,
	O write it in my heart!

</li><li>	Implant it deep within,
	Whence it may ne’er remove,
	The law of liberty from sin,
	The perfect law of love.

</li><li>	Thy nature be my law,
	Thy spotless sanctity,
	And  sweetly every moment draw
	My happy soul to Thee.

</li><li>	Soul of  my life remain!
	Who didst for all fulfil,
	In me, O Lord, fulfil again
	Thy heavenly Father’s will!
