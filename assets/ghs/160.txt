<li>	The Shepherd of Love is seeking the lost
	In paths that are rough and steep;
	He’s calling the lambs that have gone astray,
	He’s calling, calling His sheep.

<span>	Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
		Into His love, forever the same;
		Come to Him now, believe on His name,
		O answer the call today.
</span>

</li><li>	The Shepherd of Love knows His sheep by name,
	And tenderly leads the way;
	O weary one, come to the Shepherd’s fold,
	He’s calling, calling today.
</li><li>	The Shepherd of Love our ransom hath paid,
	And offers salvation free;
	He’s patiently waiting for thee to come,
	He’s calling, calling for thee.

</li><li>	The Shepherd of Love now seeketh His sheep,
	He seeketh whate’er the cost;
	Behold, He is calling the wand’rer home,
	He’s calling, calling the lost.

<span>	Out of your darkness of sin and shame,
		Into His love, forever the same;
		Come to Him now, believe on His name,
		O answer the call today.
