<li>	Jesus is the same for ever,
	As of old, so now today;
	All the hosts of hell endeavour
	Vainly to obstruct His sway.
	In His people’s hearts He reigneth,
	Finishes what He begins;
	Jesus still “all power” retaineth,
	Saves His people from their sins.

</li><li>	Jesus is the same for ever;
	Yes, He heals the sick to-day.
	As of old, so now, He never
	Turns one suffering child away.
	He can cure the worst diseases,
	For He understands our frame;
	Bore our griefs, and so releases
	All who dare their rights to claim.

</li><li>	Jesus is the same for ever;
	Still He says “In Me abide.”
	From His love no power can sever
	Those who in their Lord confide,
	Sweetly from all care He frees us,
	Ours the comfort -His the shame,
	Blessed Saviour; precious Jesus
	There’s no music like Thy name.
