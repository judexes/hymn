<li>	When first the risen Lord of pow’r
	His chosen ones sent forth,
	A charge He gave, that solemn hour,
	To preach His saving worth.
	“Go ye,’’ said He, “to all mankind;
	Declare My Word, and ye shall find:
	These signs shall surely follow them
	Who on My Name believe.’’

</li><li>	“No demons shall before them stand,
	No poison do them harm;
	Nor subtle serpent in their hand
	Cause pain or dread alarm.”
	For Satan’s kingdom He o’ercame,
	To give His people right to claim:
	“These signs shall surely follow them
	Who on My Name believe.”

</li><li>	“They shall with other tongues declare
	The wonders of their God:
	The sick beneath their hands, by prayer,
	Shall rise, to prove My Word,”
	So let it be ! Firm as His Throne
	Stands this clear promise to His own:
	“These signs shall surely follow them
	Who on My Name believe.”

</li><li>	Crowned with the flame of Pentecost,
	A faithful, fearless band
	Proclaimed His Name: a ransomed host
	Arose from every land.
	The Lord worked with them from on High,
	His proven Word could none deny:
	“These signs shall surely follow them
	Who on My Name believe.”

</li><li>	No word of Thine is void of power;
	No promise, Lord, is vain.
	Be this a Pentecostal hour -
	Confirm Thy Word again!
	Nor can’st Thou fail! Thou art the same
	As when of old Thou did’st proclaim:
	“These signs shall surely follow them
	Who on My Name believe.”
