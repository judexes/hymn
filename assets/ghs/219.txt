<li>	More holiness give me, More striving within;
	More patience in suffering, More sorrow for sin;  
	More faith in my Saviour, More sense of His care; 
	More joy in His service, More purpose in prayer.

</li><li>	More gratitude give me, More trust in the Lord; 
	More pride in His glory, More hope in His Word; 
	More tears for His sorrows, More pain at His grief; 
	More meekness in trial, More praise for relief.

</li><li>	More purity give me, More strength to o’ercome; 
	More freedom from earth-stains, More longings for home; 
	More fit for the kingdom, More used would I be; 			More blessed and holy, More, Saviour, like Thee.
