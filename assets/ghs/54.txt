<li>	Listen to the Master’s pleadings,
	There is urgent work for all,
	Heed the Spirit’s interceding,
	Give this answer to the call:

<span>	I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
		Here am I - send me, 
		I am willing to be what You’d have me be,
		I will go to where You want me to go.
		I am ready for Service for Thee, dear Lord,
		Here am I, send me, 
		Tho’ the pathway seems dark 
		For Thee I’ll do or die, I am ready for service Lord.
</span>

</li><li>	There’s a voice to you now calling,
	Will you heed the earnest word,
	On the ear it’s gently calling,
	Give this answer to your Lord:

</li><li>	Many souls in sins are dying,
	Haste to help them  while you may,
	For the time is swiftly flying,
	Will you now to Jesus say:

<span>	I am ready for service for Thee, dear Lord,
		Here am I - send me, 
		I am willing to be what You’d have me be,
		I will go to where You want me to go.
		I am ready for Service for Thee, dear Lord,
		Here am I, send me, 
		Tho’ the pathway seems dark 
		For Thee I’ll do or die, I am ready for service Lord.
