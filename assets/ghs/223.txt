<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>223</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>I GAVE MY LIFE FOR THEE</h4><ol id=“song”>   


<li>	I gave my life for thee,
	My precious blood I shed,
	That thou might’st ransomed be,
	And quickened from the dead;
	I gave, I gave My life for thee,
	What hast thou giv’n for Me?

</li><li>	I spent long years for thee
	In weariness and woe,
	That an eternity
	Of joy thou mightest know:
	I spent, I spent long years for thee;
	Hast thou spent one for Me?

</li><li>	My Father’s home of light,
	My glory-circled throne
	I left for earthly night
	For wand’rings sad and lone;
	I left, I left it all for thee,
	Hast thou left aught for Me?

</li><li>	I suffered much for thee,
	More than thy tongue can tell,
	Of bitt’rest agony -
	To rescue thee from hell;
	I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,
	What hast thou borne for Me?

</li><li>	Lord, let my life be given,
	And every moment spent,
	For God, for souls, for heaven,
	And all earth’s ties be rent
	Thou gav’st, Thou gav’st Thyself for me,
	Now I give all for Thee.
