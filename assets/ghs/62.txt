<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>62</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	GO, LABOUR ON</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Go, labour on, spend, and be spent,
	Thy joy to do the Father’s will;
	It is the way the Master went,
	Should not the servant tread it still?

</li><li>	Go, labour on; ’tis not for nought,
	Thy earthly loss is heav’nly gain.
	Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not,
	The Master praises, what are men?

</li><li>	Men die in darkness at your side,
	Without a hope to cheer the tomb:
	Take up the torch, and wave it wide,
	The torch that lights times thickest gloom.

</li><li>	Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice,
	For toil comes rest, for exile home;
	Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom’s voice,
	The midnight peal, “Behold, I come!”
