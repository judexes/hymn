<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>53</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	SO SEND I YOU

<li>	So send I you - to labour unrewarded,
	To serve  unpaid, unloved, unsought, unknown,
	To bear rebuke, to suffer  scorn and scoffing
	So send I you - to toil for Me alone.

<span>	“As the Father hath sent Me,
		So send I you.”
</span>

</li><li>	So send I you -to bind the bruised and broken,
	O’er wand’ring souls to work, to weep, to wake,
	To bear the burdens of a world a-weary
	So send I you - to suffer for My sake.

</li><li>	So send I you - to loneliness and longing
	With heart a-hung’ring for the loved and known,
	Forsaking home and kindred, friend and dear one
	So send I you - to know My love alone.

</li><li>	So send I you - to leave your life’s ambition,
	To die to dear desire, self-will resign,
	To labour long and love where men revile you
	So send I you - to loose your life in Mine.

</li><li>	So send I you - to hearts made hard by hatred,
	To eyes made blind because they will not see,
	To spend, tho’ it be blood to spend and spare not
	So send I you - to taste of Calvary.

<span>	“As the Father hath sent Me,
		So send I you.”
