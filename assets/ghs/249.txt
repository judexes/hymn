<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>249</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>COME  SING THE PRAISE OF JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Come sing the praise of Jesus,
	Sing His love with hearts aflame,
	Sing His wondrous birth of Mary,
	When to save the world He came;
	Tell the life He lived for others,
	And His mighty deeds proclaim,
	For Jesus Christ is King.

<span>	Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		For Jesus Christ is King!
</span>

</li><li>	When foes arose and slew Him,
	He was victor in the fight; 
	Over death and hell He triumphed
	In His resurrection might;
	He has raised our fallen manhood
	And enthroned it in the height,
	For Jesus Christ is King.

</li><li>	There’s joy for all who serve Him,
	More than human tongue can say;
	There is pardon for the sinner,
	And the night is turned to day;
	There is healing for our sorrows,
	There is music all the way,
	For Jesus Christ is King.
<span>	Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		For Jesus Christ is King!
</span>


</li><li>	We witness to His beauty,
	And we spread His love abroad;
	And we cleave the host of darkness,
	With the Spirit’s piercing sword;
	We will lead the souls in prison
	To the freedom of the Lord,
	For Jesus Christ is King.


</li><li>	To Jesus be the glory,
	The dominion, and the praise;
	He is Lord of all creation,
	He is Guide of all our ways
	And the world shall be His empire
	In the fulness of the days 
	For Jesus Christ is King.

<span>	Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		Praise and glory be to Jesus,
		For Jesus Christ is King!
