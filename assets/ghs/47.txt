<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>47</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	JUST  OBEY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Just as God who reigns on high,
	Spake to men in days gone by;
	So the Lord is calling men today;
	And, my brother, this is true,
	Whatso’er He says to you,
	There is but one thing to do - 
	Just obey.	
		
<span>	Just obey . . ., Just obey . . .,
		Is the way . . ., God’s way . .. ,
		When His message comes to you,
		There is but one thing to do:
		Just obey . . ., Just obey.
</span>

</li><li>	If you’re in the Saviour’s hands,
	You must do as He commands,
	For there is no other gospel way;
	Never put the message by,
	Never stop to reason “ why ”,
	When the Saviour speaks to  you - 
	Just  obey.

</li><li>	If for mansions fair you sigh,
	In that land beyond the sky,
	After time with you has pass’d away;
	Tho’ the way you may not see,
	Christ is calling, “ follow me, ”
	Faith and duty both will cry -
	Just  obey.

<span>	Just obey . . ., Just obey . . .,
		Is the way . . ., God’s way . .. ,
		When His message comes to you,
		There is but one thing to do:
		Just obey . . ., Just obey.
