 OH, THE BITTER SHAME AND SORROW

<li>	Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,
	That a time could ever be,
	When I let the Saviour’s pity
	Plead in vain, and proudly answered,
	“All of self, and none of Thee!”

</li><li>	Yet He found me; I beheld Him
	Bleeding on the accursed tree,
	Heard Him pray, “Forgive them, Father!”
	And my wistful heart said faintly-
	“Some of self, and some of Thee.”

</li><li>	Day by day His tender mercy,
	Healing, helping, full, and free,
	Sweet and strong, and, ah! so patient,
	Brought me lower, while I whispered,
	“Less of self, and more of Thee.”

</li><li>	Higher than the highest heavens,
	Deeper than the deepest sea,
	Lord, Thy love at last has conquered;
	Grant me now my supplication -
	“None of self, and all of Thee.”
