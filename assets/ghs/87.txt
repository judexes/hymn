<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>87</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	TAKE  MY LIFE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Take my life, and let it be
	Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
	Take my moments and my days,
	Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

</li><li>	Take my hands, and let them move 
	At the impulse of Thy love;
	Take my feet, and let them be
	Swift and beautiful for Thee.

</li><li>	Take my voice and let me sing
	Always, only, for my King;
	Take my lips and let them be
	Filled with messages from Thee.

</li><li>	Take my silver and my gold;
	Not a mite would I withhold;
	Take my intellect, and use
	Every power as Thou shalt choose.

</li><li>	Take my will and make it Thine,
	It shall be no longer mine;
	Take my heart, it is Thine own;
	It shall be Thy royal throne.

</li><li>	Take my love; my Lord, I pour
	At Thy feet its treasure-store;	
	Take myself, and I will be
	Ever, only, all for Thee.
