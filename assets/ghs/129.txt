<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>129</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>GRACE GREATER THAN OUR SIN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
	Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
	Yonder on Calvary’s mount outpoured	
	There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

<span>	Grace, grace, God’s grace,
		Grace that will pardon and  cleanse  within;
		Grace, grace, God’s grace,
		Grace that is greater than all our sin.
</span>

2.	Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
	Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
	Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
	Point to the Refuge, the Mighty Cross.

</li><li>	Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
	What can avail to wash it away?
	Look! there is flowing a crimson tide;
	Whiter than snow you may be today.

</li><li>	Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
	Freely bestowed on all who believe;
	You that are longing to see His face,
	Will you this moment His grace receive?

<span>	Grace, grace, God’s grace,
		Grace that will pardon and  cleanse  within;
		Grace, grace, God’s grace,
		Grace that is greater than all our sin.
</span>
