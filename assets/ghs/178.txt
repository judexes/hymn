<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>178</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>FILL MY  CUP, LORD</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Like the woman at the well I was seeking 
	For things that could not satisfy;
	And then I heard my Saviour speaking: 
	“Draw from My well that never shall run dry.”

<span>	Fill my cup, Lord, - I lift it up, Lord! 
		Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
		Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more -
		Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
</span>

</li><li>	There are millions in this world who are craving 
	The pleasure earthly things afford;
	But none can match the wondrous treasure 
	That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

</li><li>	So, my brother, if the things this world gave you 
	Leave hungers that won’t pass away;
	My blessed Lord will come and save you,
	If you kneel to Him and humbly pray:

<span>	Fill my cup, Lord, - I lift it up, Lord! 
		Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
		Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more -
		Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!
</span>
