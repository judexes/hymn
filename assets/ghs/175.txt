<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>175</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>HE IS COMING AGAIN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Lift up your heads, pilgrims aweary,
	See day’s approach now crimson the sky;
	Night shadows flee, and your Beloved,
	Awaited with longing, at last draweth nigh.

<span>	He is coming again, He is coming again,
		The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
		He is coming again, He is coming again,
		With pow’r and great glory, He is coming again!
</span>

</li><li>	Dark was the night, sin warred against us!
	Heavy the load of sorrow we bore;
	But now we see signs of His coming; -
	Our hearts glow within us,  joy’s cup runneth o’er!

</li><li>	O blessed hope! O blissful promise!
	Filling our hearts with rapture divine;
	O day of days! hail Thy appearing!
	Thy transcendent glory forever shall shine!

<span>	He is coming again, He is coming again,
		The very same Jesus, rejected of men;
		He is coming again, He is coming again,
		With pow’r and great glory, He is coming again!
</span>

</li><li>	Even so, come, precious Lord Jesus;
	Creation waits redemption to see; 
	Caught up in clouds, soon we shall meet Thee;
	O blessed assurance, forever with Thee!

</li></ol></div>
