<li>	Is there a heart o’er-bound by sorrow?
	Is there a life weighed down by care?
	Come to the cross, each burden bearing,
	All  your  anxiety - leave it there.
<span>
		All your anxiety, all your care,
		Bring to the Mercy seat, leave it there;
		Never a burden He cannot bear,
		Never a Friend like Jesus.
</span>

</li><li> 	No other Friend so keen to help you;
	No other Friend so quick to hear;
	No other place to leave your burden;
	No other one to hear your prayer.

</li><li>	Come then, at once, delay no longer;
	Heed His entreaty, kind and sweet;
	You need not fear a disappointment;
	You shall find peace at the mercy seat.

<span>
		All your anxiety, all your care,
		Bring to the Mercy seat, leave it there;
		Never a burden He cannot bear,
		Never a Friend like Jesus.
</span>
