<li>	Open  my  eyes, that I may see
	Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
	Place in my hands the wonderful key
	That shall unclasp and set me free,
	Silently now I wait for Thee,
	Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
	Open my eyes, illumine me,
	Spirit Divine!

</li><li>	Open my ears, that I may hear
	Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
	And while the wave-notes fall on my ear,
	Everything false will disappear.
	Silently now I wait for Thee,
	Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
	Open my ears, illumine me,
	Spirit Divine!

</li><li>	Open my mouth, and let me bear
	Gladly the warm truth everywhere,
	Open my heart and let me prepare,
	Love with Thy children thus to share,
	Silently now I wait for Thee,
	Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
	Open my heart, illumine me,
	Spirit Divine!

</li><li>	Open my mind, that I may read
	More of Thy love in word and deed;
	What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
	Only for light from Thee I plead,
	Silently now I wait for Thee,
	Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
	Open my mind, illumine me,
	Spirit Divine!

</li><li>	Open my way, that I may bring
	Trophies of grace to Thee, my King;
	Echoed in love Thy word shall out ring
	Sweet as the note that angels sing,
	Silently now I wait for Thee,
	Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
	Open my way, illumine me,
	Spirit Divine!
