 WHEN I SAW THE CLEANSING FOUNTAIN</h4><ol id=“song”>   


<li>	When I saw the cleansing fountain
	Open wide for all my sin,
	I obeyed the Spirit’s wooing 
	When He said “Wilt thou be clean?”

<span>	I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him,
		Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
		Give Him glory all ye people,
		For His blood has washed away my stain.
</span>

</li><li>	Though the way seemed straight and narrow,
	All I claimed was swept away;
	My ambition, plans and wishes,
	At my feet in ashes lay.

</li><li>	Then God’s fire upon the altar
	Of my heart was set aflame;
	I shall never cease to praise Him,
	Glory! glory! to His name.
<span>	I will praise Him, I will praise Him, praise Him,
		Praise the Lamb for sinners slain:...
		Give Him glory all ye people,
		For His blood has washed away my stain.
</span>


</li><li>	Blessed be the name of Jesus,
	I’m so glad He took me in;
	He has pardoned my transgressions,
	He has cleansed my heart from sin.
