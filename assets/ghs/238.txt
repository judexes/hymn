 THOU HIDDEN SOURCE OF CALM REPOSE</h4><ol id=“song”>   	
<li>	Thou hidden Source of calm repose,
	Thou all sufficient love divine;
	My help and refuge from my foes,
	Secure I am, if Thou art mine,
	From sin and grief, from guilt and shame:
	I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.

</li><li>	Thy mighty Name salvation is,
	And keeps my happy soul above;
	Comfort it brings, and power and peace,
	And joy and everlasting love;
	To me, with Thy dear Name, are given
	Pardon and holiness and heaven.

</li><li>	Jesus, my all in all Thou art,
	My rest in toil, mine ease in pain;
	The med’cine of my broken heart;
	In war, my peace; in loss, my gain:
	My smile beneath the tyrant’s frown;
	In shame, my glory and my crown.

</li><li>	In want, my plentiful supply;
	In weakness, mine almighty power;
	In bonds, my perfect liberty;
	My light in Satan’s darkest hour;
	In grief, my joy unspeakable;
	My life in death; my heaven, my all.
