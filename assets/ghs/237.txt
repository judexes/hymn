</li><li>	Peace, perfect  peace, with sorrows surging round?
	On Jesus’  bosom naught but calm is found.

</li><li>	Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
	In Jesus’ keeping we are safe and they.

</li><li>	Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
	Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.

</li><li>	Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours?
	Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.

</li><li>	It is enough; earth’s struggles soon shall cease,
	And Jesus call to heaven’s perfect peace.
