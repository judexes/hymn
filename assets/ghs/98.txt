<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>98</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THE SONG OF THE SOLDIER

<li>	Rise, ye children of salvation,
	All who cleave to Christ the Head;
	Wake, arise! O mighty nation,
	Ere the foe on Zion tread.

<span>	Pour it forth ... a mighty anthem,
		Like the thun ... ders of the sea; ...
		Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
		More than conquerors are we,...
		More than con...querors are we,...
		More than con...querors are we,...
		Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
		More than conquerors are we.
</span>

</li><li>	Saints and heroes long before us
	Firmly on this ground have stood;
	See their banners waving o’er us 
	Conquerors through Jesus’  blood.
</li><li>	Deathless we are all unfearing,
	Life laid up with Christ in God;
	In the morn of His appearing
	Floweth forth a glory flood.

</li><li>	Soon we all shall stand before Him,
	See and know our glorious Lord;
	Soon in joy and light adore Him,
	Each receiving his reward.

<span>	Pour it forth ... a mighty anthem,
		Like the thun ... ders of the sea; ...
		Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
		More than conquerors are we,...
		More than con...querors are we,...
		More than con...querors are we,...
		Thro’ the blood of Christ our ransom,
		More than conquerors are we.
