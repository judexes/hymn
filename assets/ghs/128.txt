<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>128</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>VICTORY  IN JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I heard an old, old story,
	How a Saviour came from glory,
	How He gave His life on Calvary
	To save a wretch like me;
	I heard about His groaning,
	Of His precious blood’s atoning,
	Then I repented of my sins 
	And won the victory.

<span>	 O victory in Jesus, my Saviour, forever,
		 He sought me and bought me
		 With His redeeming blood;
		 He loved me ere I knew Him, 
		And all my love is due Him,
		He plunged me to victory
		Beneath the cleansing flood.
</span>
</li><li>	I heard about His healing,
	Of His cleasing pow’r revealing,
	How He made the lame to walk again 
	And cause the blind to see;
	And then I cried, “dear Jesus 
	Come and heal my broken spirit,”
	And somehow Jesus came and bro’t  
	To me the victory.

</li><li>	I heard about a mansion
	He has built for me in glory,
	And I heard about the streets of gold 
	Beyond the crystal sea;
	About the angel singing
	And the old redemption story,
	And some sweet day I’ll sing up there
	The song of victory.
<span>	 O victory in Jesus, my Saviour, forever,
		 He sought me and bought me
		 With His redeeming blood;
		 He loved me ere I knew Him, 
		And all my love is due Him,
		He plunged me to victory
		Beneath the cleansing flood.
