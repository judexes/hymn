<li>	Since the Son hath made me free,
	Let me taste my liberty;
	Thee behold with open face,
	Triumph in Thy saving grace,
	Thy great will delight to prove,
	Glory in Thy perfect love.

</li><li>	Abba, Father, hear Thy child,
	Late in Jesus reconciled;
	Hear, and all the graces shower,
	All the joy, and peace, and power,
	All my Saviour asks above,
	All the life and heaven of love.
</li><li>	Heavenly Adam, Life divine,
	Change my nature into Thine;
	Move and spread throughout my soul,
	Actuate and fill the whole;
	Be it I no longer now
	Living in the flesh, but Thou.

</li><li>	Holy Ghost, no more delay;
	Come, and in Thy temple stay;
	Now Thine inward witness bear,
	Strong, and permanent, and clear;
	Spring of life, Thyself impart,
	Rise eternal in my heart.
	Amen.
