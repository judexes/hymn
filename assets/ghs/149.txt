<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>149</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>FARTHER ALONG</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Tempted and tried we’re oft made to wonder
	Why it should be thus all the day long,
	While there are others living about us,
	Never molested tho’ in the wrong.

<span>	Farther along we’ll know all about it,
		Farther along we’ll understand why;
		Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
		We’ll understand it all by and by.
</span>

</li><li>	When death has come and taken our loved ones,
	It leaves our home so lonely and drear;
	Then do we wonder why others prosper,
	Living so wicked year after year.

</li><li>	Faithful till death said our loving Master,
	A few more days to labour and wait;
	Toils of the road will then seem as nothing,
	As we sweep thru the beautiful gate.

<span>	Farther along we’ll know all about it,
		Farther along we’ll understand why;
		Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine,
		We’ll understand it all by and by.
</span>


</li><li>	When we see Jesus coming in glory,
	When He comes from His home in the sky;
	Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion,
	We’ll understand it all by and by.

							Holy Spirit
