<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>138</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>WHEN WE ALL GET TO HEAVEN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Sing  the wondrous love of Jesus,
	Sing  His mercy and  His grace;
	In the mansion, bright and blessed,
	He’ll  prepare  for us a place.

<span>	When we all get to heaven,
		What a day of rejoicing that will be!
		When we all see Jesus,
		We’ll sing and shout the victory.
</span>

</li><li>	While we walk the pilgrim pathway,
	Clouds will overspread the sky;
	But when trav’ling days are over,
	Not a shadow, not a sigh.

</li><li>	Let us, then, be true and faithful,
	Trusting, serving every day
	Just one glimpse of Him in glory,
	Will the toils of life repay.
<span>	When we all get to heaven,
		What a day of rejoicing that will be!
		When we all see Jesus,
		We’ll sing and shout the victory.
</span>


</li><li>	Onward to the prize before us!
	Soon His beauty we’ll behold;
	Soon the pearly gates will open,
	We shall tread the streets of gold.
