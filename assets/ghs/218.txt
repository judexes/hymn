<li>	Love divine, all loves excelling,
	Joy of heav’n, to earth come down!
	Fix in us Thy humble dwelling;
	All Thy faithful mercies crown.
	Jesus, Thou art all compassion,
	Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
	Visit us with Thy salvation;
	Enter every trembling heart.

</li><li>	Breathe, O, breathe Thy loving Spirit
	Into every troubled breast!
	Let us all in Thee inherit,
	Let us find that second rest.
	Take away our bent to sinning;
	Alpha and Omega be;
	End of faith, as its beginning,
	Set our hearts at liberty.

</li><li>	Come, Almighty to deliver,
	Let us all Thy life receive;
	Suddenly return, and never,
	Never more Thy temples leave:
	Thee we would be always blessing,
	Serve Thee as Thy hosts above.
	Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,
	Glory in thy perfect love.

</li><li>	Finish then Thy new creation,
	Pure and spotless may we be;
	Let us see our whole salvation,
	Perfectly secured by Thee:
	Changed from glory into glory,
	Till in heaven we take our place,
	Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
	Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
