<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>15 </h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	O WORSHIP THE KING</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O worship the King,
	All glorious above,
	O gratefully sing
	His power and His love:
	Our Shield and Defender,
	The Ancient of Days,
	Pavillion’d in splendour,
	And girded with praise.

</li><li>	O tell of His might,
	O sing of His grace,
	Whose robe is the light,
	Whose canopy space.
	His chariots of wrath
	The deep thunder-clouds form,
	And dark is His path
	On the wings of the storm.

</li><li>	Thy bountiful care,
	What tongue can recite?
	

	It breathes in the air,
	It shines in the light,
	It streams from the hills,
	It descends to the plain,
	And sweetly distils
	In the dew and the rain.

</li><li>	Frail children of dust,
	And feeble as frail;
	In Thee do we trust,
	Nor find Thee to fail;
	Thy mercies, how tender,
	How firm to the end,
	Our Maker, Defender,
	Redeemer, and Friend !

</li><li>	O measureless Might !
	Ineffable Love !
	While angels delight
	To hymn Thee above,
	The humbler creation,
	Though feeble their lays,
	With true adoration
	Shall lisp to Thy praise.

			                                                 Assurance & Confidence	        	      (Rejoice in the Lord)
