<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>164  </h4><h4 class="hymn-title"> PRAYER IS THE SOUL’S SINCERE DESIRE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Prayer is the soul’s sincere desire,
	Uttered or unexpressed!
	The motion of a hidden fire
	That trembles in the breast.

</li><li>	Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
	The falling of a tear,
	The upward glancing of an eye,
	When none but God is near.

</li><li>	Prayer is the simplest form of speech
	That infant lips can try;
	Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
	The majesty on high.

</li><li>	Prayer is the contrite sinner’s voice
	Returning from his ways
	While angels in their songs rejoice,
	And cry; Behold he prays!

</li><li>	Prayer is the Christian’s vital breath,
	The Christian’s native air,
	His watchword at the gates of death;
	He enters heaven with prayer.

</li><li>	O Thou by whom we come to God,
	The Life, the Truth, the Way!
	The path of prayer Thyself has trod:
	Lord! teach us how to pray.
