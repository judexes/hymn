<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>45</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	 JESUS,  MY  STRENGTH,  MY  HOPE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Jesus, my strength, my hope,
	On Thee I cast my care,
	With humble confidence look up,
	And know Thou hear’st my prayer.
	Give me on Thee to wait,
	Till I can all things do,
	On Thee, Almighty to create,
	Almighty to renew.

</li><li>	I want a godly fear,
	A quick-discerning eye
	That looks to Thee when sin is near,
	And sees the tempter fly:
	A spirit still prepared,
	And armed with jealous care,
	For ever standing on its guard
	And watching unto prayer.

</li><li>	I want a true regard,
	A single, steady aim,
	Unmoved by threatening or reward,
	To Thee and Thy great name;
	A jealous, just concern
	For Thine immortal praise;
	A pure desire that all may learn
	And glorify Thy grace.

</li><li>	I rest upon Thy word;
	The promise is for me;
	My succour and salvation, Lord,
	Shall surely come from Thee:  
	But let me still abide,
	Nor from my hope remove,
	Till Thou my patient spirit guide
	Into Thy perfect love. Amen.
