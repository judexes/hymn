<li>	Blest be the tie that binds 
	Our hearts in Christian love;
	The fellowship of kindred minds 
	Is like to that above.

</li><li>	Before our Father’s throne,
	We pour our ardent prayers;
	Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one,
	Our comforts and our cares.


</li><li>	We share our mutual woes,
	Our mutual burdens bear;
	And often for each other flows
	The sympathizing tear.

</li><li>	When we asunder part,
	It gives us inward pain:
	But we shall still be joined in heart,
	And hope to meet again.
