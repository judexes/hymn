<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>113</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>GO AND TELL THE STORY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Go and tell the story to thy friends to-day,
	How the Lord of glory met thee on thy way;
	How He cleansed thy spir-it from the stain of sin,
	Driving out the foes who reigned thy heart within.	
<span>	Go and tell the story, tell  it far and wide,
		How the Lord of glory for  the sinner died;
		And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
		Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.
</span>

</li><li>	Go and tell the story, of His pow’r to save,
	Of the sinful ‘‘legion’’ sunk beneath the wave;
	Tell of His compassion, of His love so true,
	Of  the wondrous things the  Lord hath done for you.


</li><li>	Go and tell the story, how He reigns above,
	Winning men to glory thro’  His dying love;
	How He waits to crown them kings forevermore,
	In the home awaiting, on the other shore.

<span>	Go and tell the story, tell  it far and wide,
		How the Lord of glory for  the sinner died;
		And the soul that hears it, and in faith believes,
		Straightway he the cleansing from the Lord receives.
