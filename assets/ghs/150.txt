<li>	Lord, as of old at Pentecost
	Thou didst thy pow’r display,
	With cleansing, purifying flame
	Descend on us today.

<span>	Lord, send the old-time pow’r.
		The Pentecostal pow’r!
		Thy floodgates of blessing on us Throw open  wide!
		Lord, send the old-time pow’r, the pentecostal pow’r,
		That sinners be converted and Thy name
		  glorified!
</span>

</li><li>	For mighty works for Thee prepare,
	And strengthen ev’ry heart:
	Come, take possession of Thine own,
	And never-more depart.

</li><li>	All self consume, all sin destroy!
	With earnest zeal endue
	Each waiting heart to work for Thee;
	O Lord, our faith renew!

<span>	Lord, send the old-time pow’r.
		The Pentecostal pow’r!
		Thy floodgates of blessing on us Throw open  wide!
		Lord, send the old-time pow’r, the pentecostal pow’r,
		That sinners be converted and Thy name
		  glorified!
</span>


</li><li>	Speak, Lord! before Thy throne we wait,
	Thy promise we believe,
	And will not let Thee go until
	The blessing we receive!
