<li>	There’s a call comes ringing o’er the restless wave,
	Send the light!... Send the light!
	There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
	Send the light!... Send the light!...

<span>	Send the light!... the blessed gospel light,
		Let it shine... from shore to shore!...
		Send the light!... and let its radiant beams,
		Light the world... forevermore...
</span>

</li><li>	We have heard the Macedonian call today,
	Send the light!... Send the light!
	And a golden off’ring at the cross we lay,
	Send the light!... Send the light!...

</li><li>	Let us pray that grace may everywhere abound,
	Send the light!... Send the light!
	And a Christ-like spirit everywhere be found,
	Send the light! Send the light!...
<span>	Send the light!... the blessed gospel light,
		Let it shine... from shore to shore!...
		Send the light!... and let its radiant beams,
		Light the world... forevermore...
</span>


</li><li>	Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
	Send the light!... Send the light!
	Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
	Send the light!... Send the light!...
