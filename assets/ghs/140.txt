<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>140</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>LAYING MY TREASURE UP THERE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	On the mountain of Zion beyond the blue sky,
	Stands a city so wondrous and fair;
	I expect to depart for that land, by and by,-
	For I’m laying my treasure up there.

<span>	I am laying my treasure up there, up there,
		In that beautiful city so  fair;...
		When its glories unfold I’ll have riches untold,
		For I’m laying my treasure up there.
</span>

</li><li>	There’s a mansion awaiting God’s people, I’m told,
	Which the Saviour has gone to prepare;
	There the walls are of jasper, the streets are of gold,
	I am laying my treasure up there.

</li><li>	All the love of my heart, and my soul, mind and strength,
	And the work that with Jesus I share,
	Are but some of the riches I’ll find there at length,
	For I’m laying my treasure up there.

</li><li>	So altho’ a poor pilgrim on earth I may roam,
	Ever constant in watching and prayer,
	Soon I’ll hear the glad summons to start for my home,
	For I’m laying my treasure up there.


<span>	I am laying my treasure up there, up there,
		In that beautiful city so  fair;...
		When its glories unfold I’ll have riches untold,
		For I’m laying my treasure up there.
