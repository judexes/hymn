<li>	What can wash away my stain?
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus, 
	What can make me whole again?
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

<span>	Oh, precious is the flow
		That makes me white as snow;
		No other fount I know,
		Nothing but the blood of Jesus.	
</span>

</li><li>	For my cleansing this I see - 
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
	For my pardon this my plea, -
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

</li><li>	Nothing can for sin atone,
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus:
	Nought of good that I have done,
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

</li><li>	This is all my hope and peace 
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus:
	He is all my righteousness - 
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
</li><li>	Now by this I overcome:
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus:
	Now by this I’ll reach my home:
	Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

<span>	Oh, precious is the flow
		That makes me white as snow;
		No other fount I know,
		Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
