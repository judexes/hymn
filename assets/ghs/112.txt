<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>112</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>WIN THEM ONE BY ONE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	If to Christ our only King
	Men redeemed we strive to bring,
	Just one way may this be done -
	We must win them one by one.

<span>	So you bring the one next to you
		And I’ll bring the one next to me;
		In all kinds of weather, 
		We’ll all work together,
		And see what can be done;
		If you’ll bring the one next to you,
		And I bring the one next to me,
		In no time at all we’ll have them all,
		So win them, win them, one by one.
</span>

</li><li>	Side by side we stand each day,
	Saved are we, but lost are they;
	They will come if we but dare
	Speak a word backed up by prayer.

</li><li>	Only cowards dare refuse,
	Dare this gift of God mis-use;
	Ere some friend goes to his grave,
	Speak a word his soul to save.

</li><li>	Not for hope of great reward
	Turn men’s hearts unto the Lord;
	Just to see a saved man smile
	Makes the effort well worth while.

<span>	So you bring the one next to you
		And I’ll bring the one next to me;
		In all kinds of weather, 
		We’ll all work together,
		And see what can be done;
		If you’ll bring the one next to you,
		And I bring the one next to me,
		In no time at all we’ll have them all,
		So win them, win them, one by one.
