<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>123</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>NO ONE LIKE MY SAVIOUR</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There’s no one like my Saviour;
	No friend can be like Him;
	My never failing sunshine
	When earthly lights grow dim;
	When summer flow’rs are blooming,
	The brightness of my joy,
	O, may His happy service
	My heart and life employ.

<span>	No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
		No one, no one such a friend can be;
		No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
		Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
</span>

</li><li>	There’s no one like my Saviour;
	In seasons of distress,
	He draws me closer to Him,
	To comfort and to bless;
	He gives me in temptation,
	The strength of His right arm;
	His angels camp around me,
	To keep me from all harm.

</li><li>	There’s no one like my Saviour;
	He pardons all my sin,
	And gives His Holy Spirit,
	A springing well within;
	He leads me out to service,
	With gentle touch and mild;
	O, wonder of all wonders,
	That I should be His child.

</li><li>	There’s no one like my Saviour,
	Come now, and find it true!
	He gave His life a ransom,
	His blood was shed for you;
	Then when we reach the city of everlasting light,
	We’ll sing with saints and angels,
	All honour, power and might.
<span>	No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
		No one, no one such a friend can be;
		No one, no one like my precious Saviour,
		Glory, glory, Jesus cares for me.
