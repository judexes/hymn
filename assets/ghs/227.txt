<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>227</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>NEARER, MY GOD TO THEE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
	E’en though it be a cross that raiseth me;
	Still all my song shall be,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

</li><li>	Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down,
	Darkness be over me, my rest a stone,
	Yet in my dreams I’d be
	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

</li><li>	There let the way appear, steps unto heaven;
	All that Thou sendest me, in mercy giv’n:
	Angels to beckon me
	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

</li><li>	Then with my waking thoughts, bright with Thy praise,
	Out of my stony griefs, Bethel I’ll raise;
	So by my woes to be
	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

</li><li>	Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky,
	Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upward I fly,
	Still all my song shall be,
	Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
