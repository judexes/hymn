	STANDING ON THE PROMISES</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Standing on the promises of Christ my King, 
	Thru’ eternal ages let His praises ring; 
	Glory in the highest I will shout and sing,
	Standing on the promises of God.

<span>	Stand...ing, stand...ing, 
		Standing on the promises of God my Saviour;
		Stand...ing, stand...ing,
		I’m standing on the promises of God.
</span>

</li><li>	Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
	When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
	By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
	Standing on the promises of God.

</li><li>	Standing on the promises I now can see,
	Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
	Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
	Standing on the promises of God.
<span>	Stand...ing, stand...ing, 
		Standing on the promises of God my Saviour;
		Stand...ing, stand...ing,
		I’m standing on the promises of God.
</span>


</li><li>	Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
	Bound to Him eternally by love’s strong cord,
	Overcoming daily with the Spirit’s sword,
	Standing on the promises of God.

</li><li>	Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
	List’ning ev’ry moment to the Spirit’s call,
	Resting in my Saviour, as my all in all,
	Standing on the promises of God.

<span>	Stand...ing, stand...ing, 
		Standing on the promises of God my Saviour;
		Stand...ing, stand...ing,
		I’m standing on the promises of God.
