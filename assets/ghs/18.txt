<li>	Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
	Oh, what a fore-taste of glory divine!
	Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
	Born of His Spirit, wash’d in His blood.

<span>	This is my story, this is my song,
		Praising my Saviour all the day long;
		This is my story, this is my song,
		Praising my Saviour all the day long.
</span>

</li><li>	Perfect submission, perfect delight,
	Visions of rapture now burst on my sight,
	Angels descending, bring from above
	Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

</li><li>	Perfect submission, all is at rest, 
	I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
	Watching and waiting, looking above,
	Fill’d with His goodness, lost in His love.

<span>	This is my story, this is my song,
		Praising my Saviour all the day long;
		This is my story, this is my song,
		Praising my Saviour all the day long.
