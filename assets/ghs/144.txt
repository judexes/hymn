<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>144</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>I WON’T HAVE TO CROSS JORDAN ALONE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	When I  come to the river at ending of day,
	When the last winds of  sorrow have blown;
	There’ll be somebody waiting to show me the way,
	I  won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

<span>	 I  won’t have to cross Jordan alone,
		 Jesus died for my sins to atone;
		When  the darkness I see,
		 He’ll be waiting  for me,
		I won’t have to cross  Jordan alone.
</span>

</li><li>	Often times I’m forsaken, and weary and sad,
	When it seems  that my friends  have all gone;
	There is one tho’t that cheers me and makes my heart  glad,
	I won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

</li><li>	Tho’ the billows of sorrow and trouble may sweep,
	Christ the Saviour will care for His own;
	Till the end of the journey, my soul He will keep,
	I won’t have to cross Jordan alone.

<span>	 I  won’t have to cross Jordan alone,
		 Jesus died for my sins to atone;
		When  the darkness I see,
		 He’ll be waiting  for me,
		I won’t have to cross  Jordan alone.
</span>
