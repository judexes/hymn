<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>95</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	COME, SAVIOUR JESUS FROM ABOVE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Come, Saviour, Jesus, from above!
	Assist me with Thy heavenly grace;
	Empty my heart of earthly love,
	And for Thyself prepare the place.

</li><li>	O let Thy sacred presence fill,
	And set my longing spirit free!
	Which pants to have no other will,
	But day and night to feast on Thee.

</li><li>	While in this region here below,
	No other good will I pursue;
	I’ll bid this world of noise and show,
	With all its glittering snares, adieu!

</li><li>	That path with humble speed I’ll seek,
	In which my Saviour’s footsteps shine;
	Nor will I hear, nor will I speak,
	Of any other love but Thine.

</li><li>	Henceforth may no profane delight
	Divide this consecrated soul;
	Possess it Thou, who hast the right
	As Lord and Master of the whole.

</li><li>	Wealth, honour, pleasure, and what else,
	This short-enduring world can give,
	Tempt as ye will, my soul repels,
	To Christ alone resolved to live.

</li><li>	Thee I can love, and Thee alone,
	With pure delight and inward bliss:
	To know Thou tak’st me for Thine own,
	O what a happiness is this!

</li><li>	Nothing on earth do I desire
	But Thy pure love within my breast:
	This, only this, will I require,
	And freely give up all the rest.
