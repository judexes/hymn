</li><li>	Chiefest of sinners, Jesus can save,
	As He has promised, so will He do;
	Oh, sinner, hear Him, trust in His Word,
	Then He will pass, will pass over you.

</li><li>	Judgment is coming, all will be there,
	Who have rejected, who have refused;
	Oh, sinner, hasten, let Jesus in,
	Then God will pass, will pass over you. 

</li><li>	Oh, what compassion, oh, boundless love!
	Jesus hath power, Jesus is true;
	All who believe are safe from the storm,
	Oh, He will pass, will pass over you.

		When I see the blood,  
		When I see the blood,
		I will pass, I will pass over you.
