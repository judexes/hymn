<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>169</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	What a Friend we have in Jesus,
	All our sins and griefs to bear;
	What a privilege to carry 
	Ev’rything to God in prayer.
	Oh, what peace we often forfeit,
	Oh, what needless pain we bear -
	All because we do not carry
	Ev’rything to God in prayer.

</li><li>	Have we trials and temptations?
	Is there trouble anywhere?
	We should never be discouraged,
	Take it to the Lord in prayer.
	Can we find a Friend so faithful,
	Who will all our sorrows share?
	Jesus knows our every weakness,
	Take it to the Lord in prayer.

</li><li>	Are we weak and heavy laden,
	Cumbered with a load of care?
	Precious Saviour, still our refuge, - 
	Take it to the Lord in prayer.
	Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
	Take it to the Lord in prayer;
	In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,
	Thou wilt find a solace there.
