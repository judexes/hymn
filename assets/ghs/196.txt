<li>	Does  Jesus care when my heart is pained
	Too  deeply for mirth and song;
	As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
	And the way grows weary and long?

<span>	O yes, He cares, I know He cares!
		His heart is touched with my grief;
		When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
		I know my Saviour cares.
</span>

</li><li>	Does Jesus care when my way is dark
	With a nameless dread and fear?
	As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
	Does He  care enough to be near?

 </li><li>	Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed
	To resist some temptation strong;	
	When for my deep grief I find no relief,
	Tho’ my tears flow all the night long?
<span>	O yes, He cares, I know He cares!
		His heart is touched with my grief;
		When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
		I know my Saviour cares.
</span>


</li><li>	Does Jesus care when I’ve said goodbye	
	To the dearest on earth to me,
	And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks,
  	Is it aught to Him, does He see?
