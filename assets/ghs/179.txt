<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>179</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>HIGHER  GROUND</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I’m pressing on the upward way,
	New heights I’m gaining ev’ry day;
	Still praying as I onward bound,
	“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”
		
	<span>	
		Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
		By faith, on heaven’s table-land;
		Where love, and joy, and light abound,
		Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</span>

</li><li>	My heart has no desire to stay
        Where doubts arise, and fears dismay;
	Though some may dwell where these abound,		My constant aim is higher ground.

</li><li> 	Beyond the mist I fain would rise,
	To rest beneath unclouded skies,
	Above earth’s turmoil peace is found,
	By those who dwell on higher ground.
<span>	
		Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
		By faith, on heaven’s table-land;
		Where love, and joy, and light abound,
		Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
</span>


</li><li>	I long to scale the utmost height,
	Though rough the way, and hard the fight,
	My song, while climbing, shall resound,
	Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

</li><li>	Lord, lead me up the mountain side,
	I dare not climb without my Guide;
	And, heaven gained, I’ll gaze around,
	With grateful heart from higher ground.
<span>	
		Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
		By faith, on heaven’s table-land;
		Where love, and joy, and light abound,
		Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
