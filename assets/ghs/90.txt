<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>90</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	  O LOVE THAT WILT NOT LET ME GO </h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O Love that wilt not me go,
	I rest my weary soul in Thee:
	I give Thee back the life I owe,
	That in Thine ocean depths its flow
	May richer, fuller be.

</li><li>	O Light that follow’st all my way,
	I yield my flick’ring torch to Thee:
	My heart restores its borrow’d ray,
	That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day
	May brighter, fairer be.

</li><li>	O Joy that seekest me through pain,
	I cannot close my heart to Thee:
	I trace the rainbow through the rain,
	And feel the promise is not vain,
	That morn shall tearless be.

</li><li>	O Cross that liftest up my head,
	I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
	I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
	And from the ground there blossoms red
	Life that shall endless be.
