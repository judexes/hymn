<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>148</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>NO TEARS IN HEAVEN
 
<li>	No tears in heaven, no sorrows given, 
	All will be glory in that land;
	There’ll be no sadness, all will be gladness
	When we shall join that happy band.

<span>	No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
		Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
		No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
		No tears in heaven will be known.
</span>

</li><li>	Glory is waiting, waiting up yonder,
	Where we shall spend an endless day;
	There with our Saviour, we’ll be forever,
	Where no more sorrow can dismay.

</li><li>	Some morning yonder, we’ll cease to ponder
	O’er things this life has bro’t to view;
	All will be clearer, loved ones be dearer,
	In heav’n where all will be made new.

<span>	No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
		Sorrow and pain will all have flown;
		No tears, no tears, no tears up there,
		No tears in heaven will be known.
</span>
