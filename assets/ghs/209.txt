<li>	Sweet is the promise “I will not forget thee,”
	Nothing can molest or turn my soul away;
	E’en though the night be dark within the valley,
	Just beyond is shining an eternal day.

<span>	I...will not forget thee or leave thee;
		In My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee;
		I... will not forget thee or leave thee-
		I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
</span>

</li><li>	How can I show my gratitude to Jesus,
	For His love unfailing and His tender care?
	I will proclaim to others His salvation,
	That they may accept Him and His promise share.


</li><li>	Trusting the promise “I will not forget thee,”
	Onward will I go with songs of joy and praise;
	Tho’  earth despise me, tho’ my  friends forsake me,
	Jesus will be near me gladdening my days.
<span>	I...will not forget thee or leave thee;
		In My hands I’ll hold thee, in My arms I’ll fold thee;
		I... will not forget thee or leave thee-
		I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee.
</span>


</li><li>	When at the golden portals I am standing,
	All my tribulations, all my sorrows past,
	How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation:
	“Enter, faithful servant, welcome home at last!”
