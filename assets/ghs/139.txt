<li>	There is a home eternal,
	Beautiful and bright,
	Where sweet joys supernal
	Never are dimm’d by night;
	White rob’d angels are singing
	Ever around the bright throne;
	When, oh, When shall I see thee,
	Beautiful, beautiful Home?

<span>	Home! beautiful Home!
		Bright, beautiful Home!
		Bright Home of our Saviour,
		Bright, beautiful Home!
</span>

</li><li>	Flowers are ever springing
	In that Home so fair;
	Little children singing,
	Praises to Jesus there.
	How they swell the glad anthem,
	Ever around the bright throne!
	When, oh, when shall I see thee,
	Beautiful, beautiful Home?


<span>	Home! beautiful Home!
		Bright, beautiful Home!
		Bright Home of our Saviour,
		Bright, beautiful Home!
</span>

</li><li>	Soon shall I join the ransomed,
	Far beyond the sky;
	Christ is my salvation,
	Why should I fear to die?
	Soon my eyes shall behold Him
	Seated upon the bright throne;
	Then, oh, then shall I see thee.
	Beautiful, beautiful Home?
