<li>	I am bought not with riches,
	Neither silver nor gold;
	But Christ hath redeemed me,
	I am safe in His fold;
	In the Book of His Kingdom,
	With its pages so fair,
	Through Jesus my Saviour,
	My name’s written there. 

<span>	My name’s written there,
		On the page white and fair;
		In the Book of God’s kingdom,
		My name’s written  there.
</span>

</li><li>	My sins, they were many,
	Like the sands of the sea,
	But the blood of my Saviour
	Is sufficient for me;
	For His promise is written,
	In bright letters that glow,
	“Tho’ your sins be as scarlet,
	I will make them like snow”.

</li><li>	Oh! that beautiful city,
	With its mansions of light,
	With its glorified beings,
	In pure garments of white;
	Where no evil thing cometh
	To despoil what is fair;
	Where the angels are watching,
	My name’s written there.
<span>	My name’s written there,
		On the page white and fair;
		In the Book of God’s kingdom,
		My name’s written  there.
