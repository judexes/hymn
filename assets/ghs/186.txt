<li>	God of all power, and  truth, and grace,
	Which shall from age to age endure,
	Whose word, when heaven and earth shall pass,
	Remains and stands for ever sure.

</li><li>	That I Thy mercy  may  proclaim, 			That all mankind Thy truth may see,  
	Hallow Thy  great and  glorious  name,
	And perfect holiness in me.

</li><li>	Purge  me from  every  evil  blot; 
	My idols all  be cast aside;
	Cleanse me from every sinful thought,
	From  all the filth  of self and pride.


</li><li>	Give me a new,  a perfect heart,
	From doubt, and  fear, and  sorrow free;
	The mind which  was in Christ impart,
	And let my  spirit cleave to Thee.

</li><li> 	O that I now, from  sin released,
	Thy word may to the utmost prove,
	Enter into the promised rest,
	The Canaan of Thy  perfect love! Amen.
