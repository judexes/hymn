<li>	We read of a beautiful heaven,
	Prepared for the pure and the free;
	These truths in God’s word He has given,
	How beautiful heaven must be.

<span>	How beautiful heaven must be,
		Sweet home of the happy and free;
		Fair haven of rest for the weary,
		How beautiful heaven must be.
</span>

</li><li>	In heaven, no drooping nor pining,
	No wishing for elsewhere to be;
	God’s light is forever there shining,
	How beautiful heaven must be.

</li><li>	I’m longing to go to fair heaven,
	To be with the happy and free;
	To spend the long ages in singing,
	How beautiful heaven must be .

</li><li>	The angels so sweetly are singing,
	Up there by the beautiful sea;
	Sweet chords from their gold harps are ringing,
	How beautiful heaven must be.

<span>	How beautiful heaven must be,
		Sweet home of the happy and free;
		Fair haven of rest for the weary,
		How beautiful heaven must be.
