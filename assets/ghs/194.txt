<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>194</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>O DAY OF REST AND GLADNESS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O day of rest and gladness,
	O day of joy and light,
	O balm of care and sadness,
	Most beautiful, most bright!
	On thee the high and lowly,	
	Through ages joined in tune,
	Sing: holy, holy, holy,
	To the great God Triune.

</li><li>	On thee, at the creation,
	The light first had its birth;
	On thee, for our salvation,
	Christ rose from depths of earth;
	On thee, our Lord victorious
	The Spirit sent from Heaven:
	And thus on thee most  glorious
	A triple light was given.

</li><li>	Thou  art a port protected
	From storms that round us rise;
	A garden intersected
	With streams of paradise;
	Thou art a cooling fountain
	In life’s dry dreary sand;
	From thee, like Pisgah’s mountain,
	We view our promised land.

 </li><li>	Thou art a holy ladder,
	Where angels go and come;
	Each Sunday finds us gladder,
	Nearer to heaven, our home;
	A day of sweet reflection,
	Thou art a day of love;
	A day of resurrection
	From earth to things above.

</li><li>	Today on weary nations
	The heavenly manna falls;
	To holy convocations
	The silver trumpet calls,
	Where gospel light is glowing
	With pure and radiant beams.
	And living water flowing
	With soul-refreshing streams.

</li><li>	New graces ever gaining,
	From, this our day of rest,
	We reach the rest remaining
	To spirits of the blest.
	To Holy  Ghost be praises,
	To Father, and to Son;
	The church her voice upraises
	To Thee, blest Three in One.
