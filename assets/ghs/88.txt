<li>	“Take up thy cross and follow me,’’
	I heard my Master say;
	‘‘I gave My life to ransom thee
	Surrender your all today.”

<span>	Wherever He leads I’ll go,
		Wherever He leads I’ll go,
		I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so,
		Wherever He leads I’ll go.
</span>

</li><li>	He drew me closer to His side,
	I sought His will to know,
	And in that will I now abide,
	Wherever He leads I’ll go.

</li><li>	It may be thro’ the shadows dim,
	Or o’er the stormy sea,
	I take my cross and follow Him,
	Wherever He leadeth me.

</li><li>	My heart, my life, my all I bring
	To Christ who loves me so;
	He is my Master, Lord, and King,
	Wherever He leads I’ll go.

<span>	Wherever He leads I’ll go,
		Wherever He leads I’ll go,
		I’ll follow my Christ who loves me so,
		Wherever He leads I’ll go.
