<li>	Wonderful love that rescued me,
	Sunk deep in sin,
	Guilty and vile as I could be -
	No hope within;
	When ev’ry ray of light had fled,
	O glorious day!
	Raising my soul from out the dead,
	Love found a way.

<span>	Love found a way.... to redeem my soul,...
		Love found a way ... that could make me whole;...
		Love sent my Lord ... to the cross of shame,
		Love found a way, O praise His holy name!
</span>

</li><li>	Love bro’t my Saviour here to die 
	On Calvary,
	For such a sinful wretch as I,
	How can it be?
	Love bridged the gulf ’twixt me and heav’n,
	Taught me to pray;
	I am redeemed, set free, forgiv’n,
	Love found a way.

</li><li>	Love opened wide the gates of light
	To heav’n’s domain,
	Where in eternal pow’r and might
	Jesus shall reign;
	Love lifted me from depths of woe
	To endless day,
	There was no help in earth below,
	Love found a way.

<span>	Love found a way.... to redeem my soul,...
		Love found a way ... that could make me whole;...
		Love sent my Lord ... to the cross of shame,
		Love found a way, O praise His holy name!
