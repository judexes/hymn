<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>213</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>REJOICE, THE LORD IS KING! </h4><ol id=“song”>   


<li>	Rejoice, the Lord is King!
	Your Lord and King adore;
	Mortals, give thanks and sing,
	And triumph evermore;
	Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,
	Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

</li><li>	Jesus the Saviour reigns,
	The God of truth and love;
	When He had purged our stains,
	He took His seat above;
	Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,
	Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

</li><li>	His kingdom cannot fail;
	He rules o’er earth and heaven;
	The keys of death and hell
	Are to our Saviour given;
	Lift up your heart, lift up your voice,
	Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

</li><li>	Rejoice in glorious hope;
	Jesus the Judge shall come,
	And take His servants up
	To their eternal home;
	We soon shall hear th’archangel’s voice;
	The trump of God shall sound, rejoice!
