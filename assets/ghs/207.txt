<li>	There’s a great day coming,			A great day coming,
	There’s a great day coming by and by;
	When the saints and the sinners shall be 
	   parted right and left,
	Are you ready for that day to come?

<span>	Are you ready? Are you ready?
		Are you ready for the judgment day?
		Are you ready?  Are you ready?  
		For the judgment day?
</span>

</li><li>	There’s a bright day coming, 
	A bright day coming,
	There’s a bright day coming by and by;
	But its brightness shall only come 
	  to them that love the Lord,
	Are you ready for that day to come?

</li><li>	There’s a sad day coming, 
	A sad day coming,
	There’s a sad day coming by and by;
	When the sinner shall hear his doom
	  “Depart, I know ye not,”
	Are you ready for that day to come?

<span>	Are you ready? Are you ready?
		Are you ready for the judgment day?
		Are you ready?  Are you ready?  
		For the judgment day?
