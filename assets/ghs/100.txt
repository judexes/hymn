<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>100</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>CHRIST, OUR MIGHTY CAPTAIN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Christ, our mighty Captain,  leads against the foe;
	We will never falter when He bids us go;
	Tho’ His righteous purpose we may never know,
	Yet we’ll follow all the way.
<span>	Forward! forward! ’tis the  Lord’s command,
		Forward! forward! to the  promised land;
		Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
		We are sure to win with Christ our King!
</span>

</li><li>	Satan’s fearful onslaughts cannot make us yield,
	While we trust  in Christ, our Buckler and our Shield;
	Pressing ever on - the Spirit’s sword we wield,
	And we follow all the way.

</li><li> 	Let our glorious banner ever be unfurled-
	From its mighty stronghold evil shall be hurled;
	Christ, our mighty Captain,  overcomes the world,
	And we follow all the way.

</li><li>	Fierce the battle rages, but ‘twill not be long,
	Then triumphant - shall we join the blessed  throng,
	Joyfully uniting in the victor’s song-
	If we follow all the way. 

<span>	Forward! forward! ’tis the  Lord’s command,
		Forward! forward! to the  promised land;
		Forward! forward! let the chorus ring:
		We are sure to win with Christ our King!
