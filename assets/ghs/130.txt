<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>130</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”> JUST AS I AM, WITHOUT ONE PLEA</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Just as I am, without one plea,
	But that Thy blood was shed for me,
	And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am, and waiting not 
 	To rid my soul of one dark blot,
	To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am - Though tossed about,
	With many a conflict, many a doubt,
	Fightings and fears within, without,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am - poor, wretched, blind-
	Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
	Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
	Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
	Because Thy promise I believe,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am - Thy love unknown
	Has broken every barrier, down;
	Now to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

</li><li>	Just as I am, of that free love
	The breadth, length, depth and height to prove,
	Here for a season, then above,
	O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
