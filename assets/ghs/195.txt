<li>	Another year is dawning!
	Dear Father, let it be,
	In working or in waiting,
	Another year with Thee;
	Another year of progress,
	Another year of praise,
	Another year of proving,
	Thy presence all the days.

</li><li>	Another year of mercies,
	Of faithfulness and grace;
	Another year of gladness
	The glory of Thy face;
	Another year of leaning 
	Upon Thy loving breast;
	Another year of trusting,
	Of  quiet, happy rest;

3.	Another year of service,
	Of witness for Thy love;
	Another year of training
	For holier work above.
	Another year is dawning!
	Dear Father, let it be,
	On earth, or else in heaven,
	Another year for Thee.
	

			The Lord’s Love & Care	</li></ol></div>
