<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>191 </h4><h4 class="hymn-title"> COME, HOLY GHOST, ALL-QUICKENING FIRE!</h4><ol id=“song”>    
<li>	Come Holy Ghost, all-quickening fire!
	Come, and my hallowed heart inspire,
	Sprinkled with the atoning blood;
	Now to my soul Thyself reveal,
	Thy mighty working let me feel,
	And know that I am born of God.

</li><li>	Humble, and teachable, and mild,
	O may I, as a little child,
	My lowly Master’s steps pursue!
	Be anger to my soul unknown,
	Hate, envy, jealousy, be gone;
	In love create Thou all things new.

</li><li>	Let earth no more my heart divide,
	With Christ may I be crucified,
	To Thee with my whole soul aspire;
	Dead to the world and all its toys,
	Its idle pomp, and fading  joys,
	Be Thou alone my one desire.

</li><li>	My will be swallowed up in Thee;
	Light in Thy light still may I see,
	Beholding Thee with open face,
	Called the full power of faith to prove,
	Let all my hallowed heart be love,
	And all my spotless life be praise
