<li>	From ev’ry stormy wind that blows
	From ev’ry swell-ing tide of woes;
	There is a calm, a sure retreat;
	‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

</li><li>	There is a place where Jesus sheds
	The oil of gladness on our heads;
	A place than all beside more sweet;
	It is the blood-stained mercy seat.

</li><li>	There is a scene where spirits blend
	And friend holds fellowship with friend,
	Though sundered far, by faith we meet;
	Around one common mercy seat.

</li><li>	There, there on eagle wing we soar
	And time and sense seem all no more;
	And heaven comes down our souls to greet;
	And glory crowns the mercy seat.
