<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>154</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>GIVE ME A DOUBLE PORTION</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Long ago in days of old, stood a man of God we’re told,
	As he talked to Elijah that day;
	His request he did repeat, standing at Elijah’s feet,
	“A double portion” I can hear him say.

<span>	Give me, Lord, a double portion,
		   pour Thy Spirit on me, 
		Thru eyes of faith Thy wondrous works I can see;
		But I need Thy helping hand,
		In this troubled, sinful land,
		Give me, Lord, a double portion from Thee.
</span>

</li><li>	As Elijah stood that day, to Elisha he did say,
	“Ask me what I shall do unto thee”
	And Elisha then replied, walking at Elijah’s side,
	“A double portion, let it fall on me.”

</li><li>	Lord, I always to Thee pray, just for strength from day to day,
	But I see there’s so much to be done,
	That I have to kneel a new and this favour ask of You,
	A double portion this fight must be won.
<span>	Give me, Lord, a double portion,
		   pour Thy Spirit on me, 
		Thru eyes of faith Thy wondrous works I can see;
		But I need Thy helping hand,
		In this troubled, sinful land,
		Give me, Lord, a double portion from Thee.
