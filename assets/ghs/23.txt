<li>	My faith has found a resting place,
	Not in device nor creed;
	I trust the Ever living One,
	His wounds for me shall plead.

<span>	I need no other argument,
		I need no other plea,
		It is enough that Jesus died,
		And that He died for me.
</span>

</li><li>	Enough for me that Jesus saves,
	This ends my fear and doubt;
	A sinful soul I come to Him,
	He’ll never cast me out.

</li><li>	My heart is leaning on the word,
	The written word of God,
	Salvation by my Saviour’s name,
	Salvation through His blood.

</li><li>	My great Physician heals the sick,
	The lost He came to save:
	For me His precious blood He shed,
	For me His life He gave.

<span>	I need no other argument,
		I need no other plea,
		It is enough that Jesus died,
		And that He died for me.
