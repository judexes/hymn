<li>	“The Holy Spirit’s power
	Ye need,” the Master said;
	“So wait till comes the hour 
	When on you  He is shed.”
	So praise did all their souls employ
	As tarried they with fervent joy.

</li><li>	And when ten days were passed
	With one accord were they,
	Heaven’s windows long closed fast,
	Were opened on that day;
	With rushing mighty wind and flame,
	The promised Holy Spirit came.

</li><li>	Their loosened tongues were filled
	With strange and wondrous words;
	Heaven’s life their hearts had thrilled,
	God’s goodness they declared;
	“And unto all,”  th’ Apostle said,
	“Is the like gift, since Christ has bled.”

</li><li>	Come now, ye sons of men,
	This message now receive,
	The Holy Spirit’s given
	To all who will believe;
	Ye, too, may know His mighty power,
	And speak with tongues this very hour.

</li><li>	Then charity divine,
	Your yearning hearts shall fill
	T’wards those who now repine,
	Held in sin’s bondage still;
	For these your zeal shall never tire
	To snatch them from th’  e’erlasting fire.
