	Just to take Him at His word;
	Just to rest upon His promise,
	Just to know “Thus saith the Lord.”  	

<span>	Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
		How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er!
		Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
		O for grace to trust Him more!

</li><li>	O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
	Just to trust His cleansing blood;
	Just in simple faith to plunge me
	’Neath the healing, cleansing flood! 


</li><li>	Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus
	Just from sin and self to cease;
	Just from Jesus simply taking
	Life and rest, and joy and peace.

</li><li>	I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee.
	Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
	And I know that Thou art with me,
	Wilt be with me to the end.

		How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er!
		Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
		O for grace to trust Him more!
