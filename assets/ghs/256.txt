<li>	Redeem’d how I love to proclaim it, 
	Redeem’d by the blood of the Lamb;
   	Redeem’d thro’ His infinite mercy, 
	His child and forever I am.

<span>		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		Redeem’d by the blood of the Lamb 
       		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		His child and  forever I am.
</span>
</li><li>    	Redeem’d and so happy in Jesus
   	No language my rapture can tell; 
   	I know that the light of His presence 
       	With me doth continually dwell.

</li><li>    	I think of my blessed Redeemer, 
  	I think of Him all the day long; 
  	I sing, for I cannot be silent, 
  	His love is the theme of my song.
<span>		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		Redeem’d by the blood of the Lamb 
       		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		His child and  forever I am.
</span>

</li><li> 	I know I shall see in His beauty,
     	The King in whose law I delight;
      	Who lovingly guard my footsteps,
        	And giveth me songs in the night.

</li><li>   	I know there’s a crown that is waiting 
	In yonder bright mansion for me; 
	And soon with the spirits made perfect, 
	At home with the Lord I shall be.
<span>		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		Redeem’d by the blood of the Lamb 
       		Redeem’d, Redeem’d, 
		His child and  forever I am.
