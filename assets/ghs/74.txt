<li>	There came from the skies in the days long ago
	The Lord with a message of love;
	The world knew Him not; He was treated with scorn -
	This wonderful gift from above.

<span>	They crowned Him with  thorns, 
		He was beaten with stripes;
		He was smitten and nailed to the tree,
		But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
		The heart that was broken for me...
</span>

</li><li>	He came to His own - to the ones that He loved;
	The sheep that had wandered astray;
	They heard not His voice, but the Friend of mankind
	Was hated and driven away.

</li><li>	The birds have their nests, and the foxes have holes,
	But He had no place for His head;
	A pallet of stone on the cold mountain side
	Was all that He had for His bed.
<span>	They crowned Him with  thorns, 
		He was beaten with stripes;
		He was smitten and nailed to the tree,
		But the pain in His heart was the hardest to bear,
		The heart that was broken for me...
</span>


</li><li>	I cannot reject such a Saviour as He;
	Dishonour and wound Him again;
	I’ll go to His feet and repent of my sin,
	Be willing to suffer the pain.

<span>	I’ll take up my cross, I will walk by His side,
		For the pathway of duty I see,
		I will follow my Lord and abide in His heart,			The heart that was broken for me...

</span>
