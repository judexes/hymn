<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>58</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THE LAST MILE OF THE WAY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	If  I walk in the pathway of duty,
	If  I work till the close of the day;
	I shall see the great King in His beauty,
	When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

<span>	When I’ve gone the last mile of the way,...
		I will rest at the close of the day,...
		And I know there are joys that await me,
		When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.
</span>


</li><li>	If for Christ I proclaim the glad story,
	If I seek for His sheep gone astray,
	I am sure He will show me His glory,
	When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

</li><li>	Here the dearest of ties we must sever,
	Tears of sorrow are seen ev’ry day;
	But no sickness, no sighing forever,
	When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

</li><li>	And if here I have earnestly striven,
	And have tried all His will to obey,
	
	’Twill enhance all the rapture of heaven,
	When  I’ve gone the last mile of the way.

<span>	When I’ve gone the last mile of the way,...
		I will rest at the close of the day,...
		And I know there are joys that await me,
		When I’ve gone the last mile of the way.
