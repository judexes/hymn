<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>79</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THE WAY OF THE CROSS LEADS HOME</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
	There’s no other way but this;
	I shall ne’er get sight of the Gates of Light
	If the way of the cross I miss.

<span>	The way of the cross leads home, leads home,
		The way of the cross leads home, leads home;
		It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
		The way of the cross leads home.
</span>

</li><li>	I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
	The path that the Saviour trod;
	If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
	Where the soul is at home with God.

</li><li>	Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
	To walk in it never more;
	For my Lord says “Come”, and I seek my home,
	Where He waits at the open  door.

<span>	The way of the cross leads home, leads home,
		The way of the cross leads home, leads home;
		It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
		The way of the cross leads home.
</span>
