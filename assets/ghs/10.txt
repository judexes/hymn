<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>10</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	OH,  FOR  A  THOUSAND  TONGUES  TO SING!</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing
	My great Redeemer’s praise,
	The glories of  my God and King,
	The triumphs of His grace!

</li><li>	My gracious Master and my God,
	Assist me to proclaim,
	To spread through all the earth abroad
	The honours of Thy name.

</li><li>	Jesus! the name that charms our fears.
	That bids our sorrows cease;
	’Tis music in the sinner’s ears,
	’Tis life, and health, and peace.

</li><li>	He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
	He sets the prisoner free;
	His blood can make the foulest clean,
	His blood availed for me.

</li><li>	Hear Him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,
	Your loosened tongues employ;
	Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
	And leap, ye lame, for joy!
