<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>7</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	TURN YOUR EYES UPON JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O soul, are you weary and troubled?
	No light in the darkness you see?
	There’s light for a look at the Saviour,
	And life more abundant and free!

	<span>Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
		Look full in His wonderful face,
		And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
		In the light of His glory and grace.
</span>

</li><li>	Thro’ death into life everlasting
	He passed, and we follow Him there;
	Over us sin no more has dominion -
	For more than conq’rors we are!

</li><li>	His word shall not fail you - He promised;
	Believe Him, and all will be well:
	Then go to a world that is dying,
	His perfect salvation to tell!

	<span>Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
		Look full in His wonderful face,
		And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
		In the light of His glory and grace.
</span>
