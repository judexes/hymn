<li>	There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
	A peace it can not take away;
	Though the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
	I’ve a peace that has come there to stay !

<span>	Con . . . . stantly abid . . . ing,
		    Je . . . sus is mine; . . . 
		Con . . . . stantly abid . . . ing,
		   rapture divine;
		He never leaves me lonely,
		   whispers, O so kind -
		“I will never leave thee,”
		   Jesus is mine.
</span>

</li><li>	All the world seem’d to sing of a Saviour and King,
	When peace sweetly came to my heart;
	Troubles all fled away and my night turn’d to day,
	Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

</li><li>	This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
	While here on His foot-stool I roam;
	But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
	Over there to my heavenly home!

<span>	Con . . . . stantly abid . . . ing,
		    Je . . . sus is mine; . . . 
		Con . . . . stantly abid . . . ing,
		   rapture divine;
		He never leaves me lonely,
		   whispers, O so kind -
		“I will never leave thee,”
		   Jesus is mine.
