<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>81</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	LEAD ME TO CALVARY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	King of my life, I crown Thee now,
	Thine shall the glory be;
	Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,
	Lead me to Calvary.
<span>
	 	Lest I forget Gethsemane;
		Lest I forget Thine agony;
		Lest I forget Thy love for me,
		Lead me to Calvary.
</span>

</li><li>	Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
	Tenderly mourned and wept;
	Angels in robes of light arrayed
	Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept. 

</li><li>	Let me like Mary, thro’ the gloom,
	Come with a gift to Thee;
	Show to me now the empty tomb,
	Lead me to Calvary.

</li><li>	May I be willing, Lord, to bear
	Daily my cross for Thee;
	Even Thy cup of grief to share,
	Thou hast borne all for me.

<span>
	 	Lest I forget Gethsemane;
		Lest I forget Thine agony;
		Lest I forget Thy love for me,
		Lead me to Calvary.
</span>
