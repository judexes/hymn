<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>30</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	I’VE  ANCHORED  IN JESUS  </h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Upon life’s boundless ocean where mighty 	
	  billows roll,
	I’ve fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul;
	When trials fierce assail me as storms are 
	  gathering o’er,			I rest upon His mercy and trust Him more.

<span>	I’ve anchored in Jesus, 
		The storms of life I’ll  brave,
		I’ve anchored in Jesus,
		I fear no wind or wave,
		I’ve anchored in Jesus 
		For He hath pow’r to save,				
I’ve anchored to the Rock of Ages.
</span>

</li><li>	He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace,
	His voice hath stilled the waters and bid their 
          tumult cease;
	My Pilot and Deliverer, to Him I all confide,
	For always when I need Him, He’s at my side.

</li><li>	He is my Friend and Saviour, in Him my anchor’s  cast,
	He drives away my sorrows and shields me from 		  the blast; 			By faith I’m looking upward beyond life’s troubled sea,
	There I behold a haven prepared for me.

<span>	I’ve anchored in Jesus, 
		The storms of life I’ll  brave,
		I’ve anchored in Jesus,
		I fear no wind or wave,
		I’ve anchored in Jesus 
		For He hath pow’r to save,				
I’ve anchored to the Rock of Ages.
