<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>118</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>I LOVE TO TELL THE STORY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I love to tell the story of unseen things above,
	Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love;
	I love to tell the story because I know ’tis true,
	It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.

<span>	 I love to tell  the story!
		’Twill be my theme in glory _
		To tell the old, old story 
		Of Jesus and His love.
</span>

</li><li>	I love to tell the story - ’tis pleasant to repeat
	What seems, each time  I tell it, more wonderfully  sweet;
	I love to tell the story, for some have never heard
	The message of salvation from God’s own holy word.

</li><li>	I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
	Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest;
	And when in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,
	’Twill be the old, old story that I have love so long.
<span>	 I love to tell  the story!
		’Twill be my theme in glory _
		To tell the old, old story 
		Of Jesus and His love.
</span>
