<li>   	All the darkness of the night has passed away
 	It is morning in my heart.
	I am living in the sunlight of the day,         
	It is morning in my heart.

<span>		It is morning, it is morning in my heart,
		Jesus made the gloomy shadows all depart:
		Songs of gladness now I sing, 
		For since Jesus is my King,  
 		It is morning, it is morning in my heart.
</span>
</li><li> 	I can hear the songbirds singing their refrain, 
	It is morning in my heart; 
	And I know that life for me begins again,
	It is morning in my heart. 

</li><li> 	Christ has made the world a paradise for me, 
	It is morning in my heart;
	Ev’ry duty in the light of love I see,
	It is morning in my heart.
<span>		It is morning, it is morning in my heart,
		Jesus made the gloomy shadows all depart:
		Songs of gladness now I sing, 
		For since Jesus is my King,  
 		It is morning, it is morning in my heart.
</span>

</li><li> 	Joy has come to dwell with me forever, 
	It is morning in my heart; 
	I shall sing it when I reach the other shore,
	It is morning in my heart.
