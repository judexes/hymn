<li>	Gracious Spirit dwell with me!
	I myself would gracious be,
	And with words that help and heal 
	Would Thy life in mine reveal,
	And with actions bold and meek 
	Would for Christ my Saviour speak.

</li><li>	Truthful Spirit, dwell with me! 
	I myself would truthful be; 
	And with wisdom kind and clear 
	Let Thy life in mine appear; 
	And with actions brotherly 
	Speak my Lord’s sincerity.

</li><li>	Tender Spirit, dwell with me!
    	I myself would tender be; 
   	Shut my heart up like a flower 
	In temptation’s darksome hour, 
	Open it when shines the sun, 
	And his love by fragrance own.

</li><li>	Mighty Spirit, dwell with me! 
	I myself would mighty be; 
	Mighty so as to prevail, 
	Where unaided man must fail; 
	Ever, by a mighty hope, 
	Pressing on and bearing up.

</li><li>	Holy Spirit, dwell with me! 
	I myself would holy be; 
	Separate from sin, I would 
	Choose and cherish all things good, 
	And whatever I can be 
       Give to Him Who gave me Thee!
