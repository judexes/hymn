<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>82</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
 <li>	When I survey the wondrous cross 
	On which the Prince of glory died,
	My  richest gain I count but loss,
	And pour contempt on all my pride.

</li><li>	Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
	Save in the death of Christ my God:
	All the vain things that charm me most,
	I sacrifice them to His blood.

</li><li>	See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
	Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
	Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
	Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

</li><li>	Were the whole realm of nature mine,
	That were an offering far too small;
	Love so amazing, so divine,
	Demands my soul, my life, my all.
</li></ol></div>
