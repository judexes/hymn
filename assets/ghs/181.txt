<li>	 All things are possible to him
	That can in Jesus’ name believe;
	Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,
	Thy truth I lovingly receive.
	I can, I do believe in Thee;
	All things are possible to me.

</li><li>	’Twas most impossible of all
	That here sin’s reign in me should cease;
	Yet shall it be, I know it shall;
	Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness!
	If nothing is too hard for Thee,
	All things are possible to me.

</li><li>	Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,
	The Word of God shall never fail;
	The Lord can break sin’s iron sway;
	’Tis certain, though impossible.
	The thing impossible shall be,
	All things are possible to me.

</li><li>	All things are possible to God;
	To Christ, the power of God in man;
	To me when I am all renewed,
	In Christ am fully formed again.
	And from the reign of sin set free, -
	All things are possible to me.

</li><li>	All things are possible to God;
	To Christ, the power of God in me;
	Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,
	Let me no longer live, but Thee;
	Give me this hour in Thee to prove
	The sweet omnipotence of love.
