  MORE LOVE TO THEE</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	More love to Thee, O Christ,
	More love to Thee!
	Hear Thou the prayer I make
	On bended knee;
	This is my earnest plea:
	More love, O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee,
	More love to Thee!

</li><li>	Once earthly joy I craved,
	Sought peace and rest;
	Now Thee alone I seek,
	Give what is best;
	This all my prayer shall be;
	More love, O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee,
	More love to Thee!

</li><li>	Then shall my latest breath
	Whisper Thy praise;
	This be the parting cry
	My heart shall raise;
	This still its prayer shall be:
	More love, O Christ, to Thee,
	More love to Thee,
	More love to Thee!
