<li>	Why do you wait, dear brother,
	Oh, why do you tarry so long?
	Your Saviour is waiting to give you
	A place in His sanctified throng.

<span>	Why not? Why not?
		Why not come to Him now? (2ce).
</span>

</li><li>	What do you hope, dear brother,
	To gain by a further delay?
	There’s no one to save you but Jesus,
	There’s no other way but His way.

</li><li>	Do you not feel, dear brother,
	His Spirit now striving within?
	Oh, why not accept His salvation,
	And throw off your burden of sin?
<span>	Why not? Why not?
		Why not come to Him now? (2ce).
</span>


</li><li>	Why do you wait, dear brother?
	The harvest is passing away;  
	Your Saviour is longing to bless you,
	There’s danger and death in delay!
