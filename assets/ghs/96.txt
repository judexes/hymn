<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>96</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	PEACE! BE STILL</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Master, the tempest is raging!
	The billows are tossing high!
	The sky is o’er-shadowed with blackness,
	No shelter or help is nigh:
	“Carest Thou not that we perish?”
	How canst Thou lie asleep,
	When each moment so madly is threatening
	A grave in the angry deep?

<span>	“The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
		Peace, be still!”
		Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
		Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
		No water can swallow the ship where lies
		The  Master of ocean and earth and skies;
		They all shall sweetly obey My will;
		Peace be still! peace, be still !
		They all shall sweetly obey My will:
		Peace, Peace, be still !
</span>

</li><li>	Master, with anguish of spirit
	I bow in my grief today;
	The depths of my sad heart are troubled;
	O waken and save, I pray!
	Torrents of sin and of anguish
	Sweep o’er my sinking soul !
	And I perish! I perish, dear Master;
	O hasten, and take control !

</li><li>	Master, the terror is over,
	The elements sweetly rest;
	Earth’s sun in the calm lake is mirrored,
	And heaven’s within my breast.
	Linger, O blessed Redeemer,
	Leave me alone no more;
	And with joy I shall make the blest harbour,
	And rest on the blissful shore.
