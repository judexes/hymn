	Stay Thou near by;
	Temptations lose their power
	When Thou art nigh.

	In joy or pain;
	Come quickly and abide,
	Or life is vain.

	Teach me Thy will;
	And Thy rich promises
	In me fulfil.

	Most Holy One;
	Oh, make me Thine indeed,
	Thou blessed Son!

		Ev’ry hour I need Thee;
		Oh, bless me now, my Saviour,
		I come to Thee!
