  SHOW A LITTLE  BIT  OF  LOVE  AND KINDNESS

<li>	Sing a song, spread some cheer,
	There are sad and lonely people ev’rywhere;
	Be a friend, show some love, 
	It will lift them from the dungeons of despair.

<span>  Show a little bit of love and kindness,
		Never go along with hatred’s blindness,
		Take a little time to reach for joy, and wear a    			   happy face;
		Sing a little bit when the days are dreary,
		Give a little help to a friend who’s weary-
		That’s the way to make the world a happy place!
</span>

</li><li>	Offer help, bring some hope,
	To the fainting and discouraged on life’s road;
	See a need, lend a hand,
	There are many who are crushed beneath their load.

</li><li>	Be a light, show the way,
	Be a light within the night for those astray;
	Speak a word, loving word,
	That will bring them back to walk the narrow way.

<span>  Show a little bit of love and kindness,
		Never go along with hatred’s blindness,
		Take a little time to reach for joy, and wear a    			   happy face;
		Sing a little bit when the days are dreary,
		Give a little help to a friend who’s weary-
		That’s the way to make the world a happy place!
