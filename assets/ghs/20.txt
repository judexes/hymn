<li>	“I am the Way,” the Saviour said,
	And I would follow on,
	Content to know that after night
	Shall break a glorious dawn.
<span>		“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
		No man cometh unto the Father but by me.”
		“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
		No man cometh unto the Father but by me.”
</span>

</li><li>	“I am the Truth,” then Truth shall be,
	A beacon light to guide
	My bark across the Stormy Sea
	To where still waters glide.

</li><li>	“I am the Life,” there is no death,
	For me to fear nor dread,
	Since by His all-atoning blood,
	My life to His is wed.

<span>	“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
		No man cometh unto the Father but by me.”
		“I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,
		No man cometh unto the Father but by me.”
