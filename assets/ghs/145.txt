<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>145</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>WHEN THEY RING THE GOLDEN BELLS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There’s a land beyond the river,
	That we call the sweet forever,
	And we only reach that shore by faith’s decree;
	One by one we’ll gain the portals,
	There to dwell with the immortals,
	When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

<span>	Don’t you hear the bells now ringing?
		Don’t you here the angels singing?
		’Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee 
		In that far-off sweet forever,
		Just beyond the shining river, 
		When they ring the golden bells for you and me 
</span>

</li><li> 	We shall know no sin or sorrow,
	In that haven of tomorrow,
	When our barque shall sail beyond the silver sea;
	We shall only know the blessing 
	Of our Father’s sweet caressing,
	When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

</li><li>	When our days shall know their number,
	When in death we sweetly slumber,
	When the King commands the spirit to be free;
	Nevermore with anguish laden,
	We shall reach that lovely Aiden, 
	When they ring the golden bells for you and me.

<span>	Don’t you hear the bells now ringing?
		Don’t you here the angels singing?
		’Tis the glory hallelujah Jubilee 
		In that far-off sweet forever,
		Just beyond the shining river, 
		When they ring the golden bells for you and me 
</span>
