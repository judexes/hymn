<li>	I shall see the King 
	Where the angels sing,
	I shall see the King some day,
	In the better land,
	On the golden strand,
	And with Him shall ever stay.
		
<span> In His glory, I shall see the King,
		And forever endless praises sing;
		’Twas on calvary Jesus died for me;
		I shall see the King some day.
</span>

</li><li>	In the land of song, 
	In the glory throng,
	Where there never comes a night,				With my Lord once slain 
	I shall ever reign
	In the glory-land of light.

</li><li>	I shall see the King, 
	All my tributes bring,
	And shall look upon His face;
	Then my song shall be
	How He ransomed me
	And has kept me by His grace.

<span> In His glory, I shall see the King,
		And forever endless praises sing;
		’Twas on calvary Jesus died for me;
		I shall see the King some day.
</span>
