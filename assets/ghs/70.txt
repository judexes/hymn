<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>70</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	HAVE YOU ANY ROOM FOR JESUS?</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Have you any room for Jesus, 
	He who bore your load of sin?
	As He knocks and asks admission,
	Sinners, will you let Him in?

<span>	Room for Jesus, King of glory,
		Hasten now, His word obey,
		Swing the heart’s door widely open,
		Bid Him enter while you may.
</span>
</li><li>	Room for pleasure, room for business,
	But for Christ the crucified;
	Not a place that He can enter,
	In your heart for which He died?

</li><li>	Have you any time for Jesus,
	As in grace He calls again?
	O today is time accepted,
	Tomorrow you may call in vain.

</li><li>	Room and time now give to Jesus,
	Soon will pass God’s day of  grace;
	Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
	And thy Saviour’s pleading cease.

<span>	Room for Jesus, King of glory,
		Hasten now, His word obey,
		Swing the heart’s door widely open,
		Bid Him enter while you may.
</span>
