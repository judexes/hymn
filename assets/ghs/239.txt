	ONE THERE IS ABOVE ALL OTHERS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	One there is above all others,
	Well deserves the name of Friend;
	His is love beyond a brother’s, 
	Costly, free, and knows no end:
	They who once His kindness prove,
	Find it everlasting love.

</li><li>	Which of all our friends, to save us, 
	Could or would have shed his blood?
	But our Jesus died to have us
	Reconciled in Him to God:
	This was boundless love indeed;
	Jesus is a Friend in need.

</li><li>	When He lived on earth abased
	“Friend of sinners”  was His name;
	Now above all glories raised,
	He rejoices in the same;
	Still He calls them brethren, friends,
	And to all their wants attends.
</li><li>	O, for grace our hearts to soften!
	Teach us, Lord, at length to love;
	We, alas! forget too often
	What a Friend we have above;
	But when home our souls are brought
	We shall love Thee as we ought.
