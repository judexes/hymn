<li>	Have you wandered away from your Father’s care,
	Heavy-hearted and sad do you roam?	
	There’s a sweet gentle voice calling now to you - 
	Wand’ring child, wand’ring child, O, come home.

<span>	Child, come home, child, come home,
		Wand’ring child, why longer roam?
		’Tis thy Father  entreats,
		Wand’ring child, O, come home.
</span>

</li><li>	Is your frail bark adrift on life’s raging sea,
	Are you tossed on its billows and foam?
	There’s a safe harbour home, waiting now for you -
	Wand’ring child, wand’ring child, O, come home.

</li><li>	He is pleading today, heed His gentle voice,
	As He bids you no longer to roam,
	To that dear Father’s house haste without delay - 
	Wand’ring child, wand’ring child, O, come home.

<span>	Child, come home, child, come home,
		Wand’ring child, why longer roam?
		’Tis thy Father  entreats,
		Wand’ring child, O, come home.
</span>
