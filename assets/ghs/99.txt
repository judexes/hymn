<li>	There is vict’ry within my soul
	For the Spirit with me abides,
	Let the waves of temptation roll,
	Jesus keeps me whate’er betides.

<span>	Victory, Victory, Vict’ry in my soul,
		I have glorious victory
		Since Jesus took control,
		Victory, Victory, sweeping like a flood,
		I have glorious victory thro’ Jesus’ blood.
</span>

</li><li>	Tho’ the conflict be fierce and long,
	Tho’ the tempter my heart assail,
	In my weakness yet I am strong,
	For with Jesus I’ll e’er prevail.

</li><li>	I have victory over sin,
	I have victory o’er grave;
	Even death now has lost its sting,
	Halleluyah I know I’m saved.

<span>	Victory, Victory, Vict’ry in my soul,
		I have glorious victory
		Since Jesus took control,
		Victory, Victory, sweeping like a flood,
		I have glorious victory thro’ Jesus’ blood.
