<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>142</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>‘‘HOLY, HOLY’’ IS WHAT THE  ANGELS SING</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There is singing up in heaven
	  such as we have never known,
	Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamb 		  upon the throne;
	Their sweet harps are ever tuneful and their 			 	 voices alway clear,
	O that we might be more like them while we 			 	 serve the Master here!

<span>	‘‘Holy, holy’’ is what the angels sing,
		And I expect to help them make the courts of  		
		heaven ring;
		But when I sing redemption’s story they will 			  fold their wings,
		For angels never felt the joys that 
		  our salvation brings.	
</span>

</li><li>	But I hear another anthem,
	  blending voices clear and strong,
	“Unto Him who hath  redeemed us 
	  and hath  bought us,’’ is the song;
	We have come thru tribulations  
	  to this land so fair and  bright,
	In the fountain freely flowing
	He  hath made our garments white.

</li><li>	Then the angels stand and listen,
	  for they cannot join that song,
	Like the sound of many waters,
	  by that happy, blood washed  throng;
	For they sing about great trials,
	  battles fought and  vict’ries won,
	And they praise their great
	Redeemer who hath said to them, “well  done”.
<span>	‘‘Holy, holy’’ is what the angels sing,
		And I expect to help them make the courts of  		
		heaven ring;
		But when I sing redemption’s story they will 			  fold their wings,
		For angels never felt the joys that 
		  our salvation brings.	
</span>


</li><li>	So, altho’  I’m not an angel ,
  	  yet I know that over there 
	I will join a blessed chorus that the angels  			  cannot share;
	I will sing about my Saviour,
	  who upon dark Calvary
	Freely pardoned my transgression, 
	  died to set a sinner free.
