<li>	Speak a word, a loving word for Jesus,
	Ev’rywhere you go;
	Tell poor sinners how He died to save them
	From eternal woe.

<span>	Speak a word for Jesus, speak it quickly,
		Swiftly glides the time away,...
		Daily tell the wondrous story of the Master’s glory,
		Speak a loving word today.
</span>

</li><li>	Speak a word, a tender word for Jesus,
	To the sin-sick soul;
	Tell him Christ, who came to save the vilest,
	Waits to  make him whole.

</li><li>	Speak a word, a warning word for Jesus,
	Speak it day by day,
	Strive to lead some weak and wand’ring brother
	In the narrow way.

<span>	Speak a word for Jesus, speak it quickly,
		Swiftly glides the time away,...
		Daily tell the wondrous story of the Master’s glory,
		Speak a loving word today.
