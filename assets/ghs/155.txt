		Just now, reject Him no more;
		Just now, throw open the door;
		Let Jesus come into your heart.

	Let Jesus come into your heart;
	If there’s a void this world never can fill,
	Let Jesus come into your heart.

<span>	Just now, your doubtings give o’er;
		Just now, reject Him no more;
		Just now, throw open the door;
		Let Jesus come into your heart.

	Let Jesus come into your heart;
	If you would enter the mansions of rest,
	Let Jesus come into your heart.
