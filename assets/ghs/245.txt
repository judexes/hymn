<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>245 </h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>  IS YOUR LIFE A CHANNEL OF BLESSING? </h4><ol id=“song”>   


<li>	Is your life a channel of blessing?
	Is the love of God flowing thro’ you?
	Are you telling the lost of the Saviour?
	Are you ready His service to do?

<span>	Make me a channel of blessing today,
		Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
		

		My life possessing, My service blessing,
		Make me a channel of blessing today.
</span>

</li><li>	Is your life a channel of blessing?
	Are you burdened for those that are lost?
	Have you urged upon those who are straying,
	The Saviour who died on the cross?

</li><li>	Is your life a channel of blessing?
	Is it daily telling for Him?
	Have you spoken the word of salvation 
	To those who are dying in sin?
<span>	Make me a channel of blessing today,
		Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
		

		My life possessing, My service blessing,
		Make me a channel of blessing today.
</span>


</li><li>	We cannot be channels of blessing
	If our lives are not free from all sin;
	We will barriers be and a hindrance 
	To those we are trying to win.
