<li>	All that drew me I have left behind
	Here in Canaan better joys I find;
	Peace abiding, blessings unconfined,
	For I’m living in Canaan now.

<span>	I am living in Canaan now,
		Where the showers of blessing abound,
		Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
		I am living in Canaan now.
</span>

</li><li>	Safe abiding I will never fear,
	For my Saviour ever will be near;
	When I call Him He will always hear,
	For I’m living in Canaan now.
</li><li>	I am drinking from a ceaseless well;
	Here in Canaan where I love to dwell,
	So to others I am glad to tell,
	That I’m living in Canaan now.

</li><li>	Praises ever I am glad to bring
	Unto Jesus, my Redeemer King,
	For His mercies I will shout and sing,
	For I’m living in Canaan now.

<span>	I am living in Canaan now,
		Where the showers of blessing abound,
		Where the riches of grace in plenty are found,
		I am living in Canaan now.
