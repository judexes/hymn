<li>	Oft in danger, oft in woe,
	Onward, Christians, onward go;
	Fight the fight, maintain the strife,
	Strengthened with the Bread of Life.
</li><li>	Shrink not, Christians: will ye yield?
	Will ye quit the painful field?
	Will ye flee in danger’s hour?
	Know ye not your Captain’s power?

</li><li>	Let your drooping hearts be glad;
	March in heavenly armour clad:
	Fight, nor think the battle long;
	Soon shall victory tune your song.

</li><li>	Let not sorrow dim your eye,
	Soon shall every tear be dry;
	Let not fears your course impede,
	Great your strength if great your need.

</li><li>	Onward then to glory move,
	More than conquerors ye shall prove;
	Though opposed by many a foe,
	Christian soldiers, onward go.

<span>	“The winds and the waves shall obey My will,
		Peace, be still!”
		Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
		Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
		No water can swallow the ship where lies
		The  Master of ocean and earth and skies;
		They all shall sweetly obey My will;
		Peace be still! peace, be still !
		They all shall sweetly obey My will:
		Peace, Peace, be still !
</span>
