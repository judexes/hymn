<li>	Deeper, deeper, in the  love of  Jesus,
	Daily let me go;
	Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,
	More of grace to know.

		And high---er every day---
		And wis---er, blessed Lord,
		In Thy precious, holy word.

</li><li>	Deeper, deeper! blessed Holy  Spirit,
	Take me deeper still,
	Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
	And His perfect will.

</li><li>	Deeper, deeper! though it cost hard trials,
	Deeper let me go!
	Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
	Let me fruitful grow.

</li><li>	Deeper, higher every day in Jesus,
	Till all conflict past,
	Finds me conqu’ror, and in His own image
	Perfected at last .
