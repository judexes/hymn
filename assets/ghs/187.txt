<li>	Jesus, all-atoning Lamb,
	Thine, and only Thine, I am:
	Take my body,  spirit, soul;
	Only Thou possess the whole.

</li><li>	Thou my one thing needful be;
	Let me ever cleave to Thee;
	Let me choose the better  part;
	Let me give Thee all my heart.

</li><li>	Fairer than the sons of men,
	Do not let me turn again,
	Leave the fountain-head of bliss,
	Stoop to creature-happiness.

</li><li>	Whom have I on earth below?
	Thee, and only Thee, I know;
	Whom have I in heaven but Thee?
	Thou art all in all to me.

</li><li>	All my treasure is above,
	All my riches is Thy love:
	Who the worth of love can tell?
	Infinite, unsearchable.
