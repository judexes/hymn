<li>	“Almost persuaded:” now to believe;
	“Almost persuaded:” Christ to receive;
	Seems now some soul to say,
	“Go, Spirit, go Thy way:
	Some more convenient day
	On Thee I’ll call.’’
</li><li>	“Almost persuaded:” come, come today!
	“Almost persuaded:” turn not away!
	Jesus invites you here,
	Angels are lingering near,
	Prayers rise from heart so dear,
	O wanderer, come!

</li><li>	“Almost persuaded:’’ harvest is past!
	“Almost persuaded:’’ doom comes at last!
	“Almost’’ cannot avail;
	“Almost’’ is but to fail:
	Sad, sad, that bitter wail - 
	“Almost’’ - but lost!
			Prayer
