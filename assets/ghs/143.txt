<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>143.</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>THE END OF THE ROAD</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	When I come to the end of the long, long road,
	The shadows will flee away,
	And I’ll stand in the glorious light of God,
	Where dwelleth eternal day...
<span>	When I come to the end, the end of the road,
		To the land of eternity,
		When I come to the end of life’s long road,
		The face of my Lord I’ll see.
</span>

</li><li>	Looking back o’er the years that were hard and drear,
	The hand of the Christ I’ll see; 
	While my heart will go forth with a song of praise,
	Because of His love for me...

</li><li>	When I come to the end of the long, long, road,
	And trials will all be past ,
	I  shall look in the face of my dearest Friend,
	Safe home in His heav’n at last....

<span>	When I come to the end, the end of the road,
		To the land of eternity,
		When I come to the end of life’s long road,
		The face of my Lord I’ll see.
