<li>	Face to face with Christ, my Saviour,
	Face to face -what will it be?
	When with rapture I behold Him,
	Jesus Christ who died for me!

<span>	Face to face I shall behold Him,
		Far beyond the starry sky;
		Face to face, in all His glory,
		I shall see Him by and by!
</span>
</li><li>	Only faintly now I see Him,
	With the darkling veil between;
	But a blessed day is coming,
	When His glory shall be seen.

</li><li>	What rejoicing in His presence,
	When are banished grief and pain,
	When the crooked ways are straightened
	And the dark things shall be plain.
<span>	Face to face I shall behold Him,
		Far beyond the starry sky;
		Face to face, in all His glory,
		I shall see Him by and by!
</span>


</li><li>	Face to face - O blissful moment!
	Face to face to see and know;
	Face to face with my Redeemer,
	Jesus Christ who loves me so!
