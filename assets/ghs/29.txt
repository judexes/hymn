<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>29</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	I  KNOW  WHO  HOLDS  TOMORROW</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I don’t know about tomorrow,
	I just live from day to day;
	I don’t borrow from it’s sunshine,
	For it’s skies may turn to gray;
	I don’t worry o’er the future,
	For I know what Jesus said,
	And today I’ll walk beside Him,
	For He knows what is ahead.

<span>	Many things about tomorrow
		I don’t seem to understand;
		But I know who holds tomorrow,
		And I know who holds my hand.
</span>

</li><li>	Ev’ry step is getting brighter
	As the golden stairs I climb;
	Ev’ry burden’s getting lighter,
	Ev’ry cloud is silver lined;
	There the sun is always shining,
	There no tear will dim the eye;
	At the ending of the rainbow,
	Where the mountains touch the sky.

</li><li>	I don’t know about tomorrow,
	It may bring me poverty;
	But the One who feeds the sparrow
	Is the One who stands by me;
	And the path that be my portion,
	May be through the flame or flood,
	But His presence goes before me,
	And I’m covered with His blood.

<span>	Many things about tomorrow
		I don’t seem to understand;
		But I know who holds tomorrow,
		And I know who holds my hand.
