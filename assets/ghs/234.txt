<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>234</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>O LORD, “WITH ONE ACCORD”.</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O Lord, “with one accord,”
	We gather round Thy Throne,
	To hear Thy holy Word,
	To worship Thee alone.
	Now send from heaven the Holy Ghost,
	Be this another Pentecost!

</li><li>	We have no strength to meet 
	The storms that round us lower,
	Keep Thou our trembling feet
	In every  trying hour;
	More than victorious shall we be
	If girded with Thy panoply.

</li><li>	Where is the mighty wind
	That shook the holy place,
	That gladdened every mind,
	And brightened every face?
	And where the cloven tongues of flame
	That marked each follower of the Lamb?

</li><li>	There is no change in Thee,
	Lord God the Holy Ghost,
	Thy glorious majesty 
	Is as at Pentecost!
	O may our loosened tongues proclaim,
	That Thou, our God, art still the same.

</li><li>	And may that living wave, 
	That issues from on high,
	Whose golden waters lave 
	Thy throne eternally:
	Flow down in power on us to-day,
	And none shall go unblessed away!

</li><li>	Anoint us with Thy grace,
	To yield ourselves to Thee;
	To run our daily race, 
	With joy and energy,
	Until we hear the Bridegroom say,
	“Rise up my love, and come away”.
