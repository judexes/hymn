<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>204</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
	To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
	The Master made answer in words true and plain,
	“Ye must be born again!”

<span>	“Ye must be born again!”
		“Ye must be born again!”
		I verily, verily say unto thee -
		“Ye must be born again!”
</span>



</li><li>	Ye children of men attend to the word
	So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord,
	And let not this message to you be in vain,
	“Ye must be born again!”

</li><li>	O ye who would enter that glorious rest,
	And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest;
	The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
	“Ye must be born again.”
<span>	“Ye must be born again!”
		“Ye must be born again!”
		I verily, verily say unto thee -
		“Ye must be born again!”
</span>


</li><li>	A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,
	At the beautiful gates may be watching for thee;
	Then list to the note of this solemn refrain,
	“Ye must be born again.”
