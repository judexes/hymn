<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>35</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	A  NEW  NAME  IN  GLORY</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I was once a sinner, but I came 
	Pardon to receive from my Lord:
	This was freely given, and I found
	That He always kept His word.

<span>	There’s a new name written down in glory,
		And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine !
		And the white-robed angels sing the story
		“A sinner has come home.”
		For there’s a new name written down in glory,
		And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine;
		With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
		Never more to roam.
</span>
</li><li>	I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
	Fearing naught but God’s angry frown;
	When the heavens opened and I saw
	That my name was written down.

</li><li>	In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,”
	O the joy that came to my soul!
	Now I am forgiven, and I know
	By the blood I am made whole.
<span>	There’s a new name written down in glory,

		And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine;
