<li>	Where will you spend eternity?
	This question comes to you and me!
	Tell me, what shall your answer be?
	Where will you spend, eternity?
<span>	Eternity! Eternity!
		Where will you spend, eternity?
</span>

</li><li>	Many are choosing Christ today,
	Turning from all their sins away;
	Heav’n shall their happy portion be;
	Where will you spend eternity?
<span>	Eternity! Eternity!
		Where will you spend, eternity?
</span>
	

</li><li>	Leaving the strait and narrow way,
	Going the downward road today,
	Sad will their final ending be,
	Lost thro’ a long eternity!
<span>	Eternity! Eternity!
		Lost through a long eternity!
</span>	

</li><li>	Repent, believe, this very hour,
	Trust in the Saviour’s grace and power;
	Then will your joyous answer be,
	Saved through a long eternity!
<span>	Eternity! Eternity!
		Saved through a long eternity!
