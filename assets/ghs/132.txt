<li>	Since the Saviour came to this heart of mine,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over,
	Filling my poor soul with His joy divine,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over.

<span>	Ru. . .  nning over,
		Ru. . .  nning over,
		My cup’s fill’d and running over,
		Since the Lord saved me,
		I’m as happy as can be,
		My cup’s fill’d and running over.

</li><li>	With my Lord so dear, I have naught to fear,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over,
	Tho’ my way be drear He is ever near,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over.

</li><li>	Even tho’ I walk thro’ death’s darksome vale,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over,
	Christ my Lord shall be my comfort still,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over.

</li><li>	Sinner, seek the Lord, trust His precious word,
	While the angels round you hover,
	Heaven’s bells will ring, and you then will sing,
	My cup’s fill’d and running over.

<span>	Ru. . .  nning over,
		Ru. . .  nning over,
		My cup’s fill’d and running over,
		Since the Lord saved me,
		I’m as happy as can be,
		My cup’s fill’d and running over.
