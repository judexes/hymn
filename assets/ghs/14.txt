<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>14</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	HOW GREAT THOU ART</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder,
	Consider all the works Thy hands hath made,
	I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
	Thy pow’r thro’ out the universe displayed,

<span>	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
		How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
		Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
		How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
</span>

</li><li>	When through the woods and forest glades I wander,
	And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;
	When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
	And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze;

</li><li>	And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
	Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
	That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
	He bled and died to take away my sin;

</li><li>	When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation,
	And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
	Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
	And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

<span>	Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
		How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
		Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee;
		How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
