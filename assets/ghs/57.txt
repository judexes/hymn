<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>57</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THEY THAT WAIT UPON THE LORD

<li>	Ho, reapers in the whitened harvest!
	Oft feeble, faint, and few;
	Come, wait upon the blessed Master,
	Our strength He will renew.

<span>	For “they that wait upon the Lord... shall 
		   renew... their strength, they shall mount up 			    with wings, they shall mount up with wings as eagles:
		They shall run... and not be weary; they shall 			    walk and not faint;
		They shall run... and not be weary; they 				   shall  walk and not faint;
		They shall run and not be weary, shall walk 			   and not faint.”
</span>

</li><li>	Too oft a-weary and discouraged,
	We pour a sad complaint;
	Believing in a living Saviour,
	Why should we ever faint?

</li><li>	Rejoice! for He is with us alway,
	Lo, even to the end!
	Look up! take courage and go forward - 
	All needed grace He’ll send!

<span>	For “they that wait upon the Lord... shall 
		   renew... their strength, they shall mount up 			    with wings, they shall mount up with wings as eagles:
		They shall run... and not be weary; they shall 			    walk and not faint;
		They shall run... and not be weary; they 				   shall  walk and not faint;
		They shall run and not be weary, shall walk 			   and not faint.”
