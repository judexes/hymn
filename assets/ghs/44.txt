<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>44</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	COME OVER</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There’s a land of peace and plenty, 
	   and its gates are open wide;
	And the pure in heart and 
	   holy in its shelter may abide,
	It is not thro’ gates of glory
	   that a soul must enter in;
	But all who would find entrance 
	   there must leave the ways of sin.

<span>	Come over, come over, 
		   to the land of corn and wine,
		There is nothing can compare with the many
		  holy pleasures there,
		Come over, come over, leave the 
		  desert plain below and come away,
		Away, come o . . . ver.
</span>

</li><li>	There is bread of heaven growing, 
	   in its fair and fertile fields,
	And the wine of love its 
	   vineyard to the thirsting mortal yields;
	There are mountain heights of 
	   glory that await the trav’lers rod,
	And blest retreats where
	  empty souls draw nearer unto God.

</li><li>	Who would stay without its borders, 
	   in the desert dark and drear,
	When the luscious grapes of
	   eschol are so very, very, near?
	Enter in then with rejoicing,
	   for the Lord is on your side,
	And in His glorious presence
	   ever more you shall abide.



<span>	Come over, come over, 
		   to the land of corn and wine,
		There is nothing can compare with the many
		  holy pleasures there,
		Come over, come over, leave the 
		  desert plain below and come away,
		Away, come o . . . ver.
