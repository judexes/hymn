<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>102	</h4><h4 class="hymn-title">THE  HEALER

<li> 	On the Cross crucified, 
	In great sorrow He died;
	The Giver of life was He - 
	Yet my Lord was despised and rejected of men,
	This Jesus of Calvary.

<span>	He was wounded for our transgressions,
		He was bruised for our  iniquities;
		Surely He bore our sorrows,
		And by His stripes we are healed.
</span>

</li><li>	Price for healing was paid,
	As those cruel stripes were made,
	Within Pilate’s judgment hall-
	Now His suff’ring afford perfect healing for all,
	This wonderful Healer’s mine.

</li><li>	Came the leper to Christ, 
	Saying “Surely I know,
	That Thou, Lord, canst make me whole.”-
	When his great faith was seen Jesus said, “Yes, I will.”
	And touched him and made him clean.

</li><li>	He has healed my sick soul, 
	Made me ev’ry whit whole,
	And He’ll do the same to you -
	He’s the same yesterday and today and for ever,
	This Healer of men today.
<span>	He was wounded for our transgressions,
		He was bruised for our  iniquities;
		Surely He bore our sorrows,
		And by His stripes we are healed.
