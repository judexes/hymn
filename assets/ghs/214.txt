 ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS’ NAME!</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	All hail the power of Jesus’ name!
	Let angels prostrate fall;
	Bring forth the royal diadem,
	And crown Him Lord of all.

</li><li>	Crown Him, ye martyrs of our God,
	Who from His altar call;
	Extol the stem of Jesse’s rod,
	And crown Him Lord of all.

</li><li>	Ye chosen seed of Israel’s race,
	A remnant weak and small,
	Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
	And crown Him Lord of all.

</li><li>	Ye Gentile sinners, ne’er forget
	The wormwood and the gall;
	Go, spread your trophies at His feet,
	And crown Him Lord of all.

</li><li>	Let every kindred, every tribe,
	On this terrestrial ball,
	To Him all majesty ascribe,
	And crown Him Lord of all.

</li><li>	O that with yonder sacred throng
	We at His feet may fall,
	Join in the everlasting song,
	And crown Him Lord of all.
