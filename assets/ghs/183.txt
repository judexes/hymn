<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>183</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>COME, O MY GOD, THE PROMISE SEAL</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Come, O my God, the promise seal,
	This mountain, sin, remove;
	Now in my fainting soul reveal
	The virtue of Thy love.

</li><li>	I want Thy life, Thy purity,
	Thy righteousness brought in;
	I ask, desire, and trust in Thee,
	To be redeemed from sin.

</li><li>	Anger and sloth, desire and pride,
	This moment be subdued;
	Be cast into the crimson tide 
	Of my Redeemer’s blood!

</li><li>	Saviour, to Thee my soul looks up,
	My present Saviour Thou!
	In all the confidence of hope,
	I claim the blessing now.

</li><li>	’Tis done! Thou does this moment
	With full salvation bless;
	Redemption through Thy blood I have, 			Save, and spotless love and peace.
