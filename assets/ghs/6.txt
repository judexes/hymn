<li>	Yield not to temptation,
	For yielding is sin;
	Each victory will help you
	Some other to win;
	Fight manfully onward,
	Dark passions subdue;
	Look ever to Jesus,
	He’ll carry you through.
<span>
		Ask the Saviour to help you;
		Comfort, Strengthen, and keep you;
		He is willing to aid you,
		He will carry you through.
</span>
</li><li>	Shun evil companions,
	Bad language disdain;
	God’s name hold in reverence,
	Nor take it in vain;
	Be thoughtful and earnest,
	Kind-hearted and true;
	Look ever to Jesus,
	He’ll carry you through.

</li><li>	To him that o’ercometh, 
	God giveth a crown;
	Thro’ faith we will conquer,
	Though often cast down;
	He who is our Saviour,
	Our strength will renew;
	Look ever to Jesus,
	He’ll carry you through.

		Ask the Saviour to help you;
		Comfort, Strengthen, and keep you;
		He is willing to aid you,
		He will carry you through.
