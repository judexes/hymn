<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>65</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	O HOW I LOVE JESUS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	There is a name I love to hear,
	I love to sing its worth;
	It sounds like music in mine ear,
	The sweetest name on earth.

<span>	O how I love Jesus,
		O how I love Jesus,
		O how I love Jesus,
		Because He first loved me!
</span>

</li><li>	It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
	Who died to set me free;
	It  tells me of His precious blood,
	The sinner’s perfect plea.

</li><li>	It tells me what my Father hath
	In store for ev’ry day,
	And tho I tread a dark-some path,
	Yields sunshine all the way.

</li><li>	It tells of One whose loving heart
	Can feel my deepest woe,
	Who in each sorrow bears a part
	That none can bear below.

<span>	O how I love Jesus,
		O how I love Jesus,
		O how I love Jesus,
		Because He first loved me!
</span>
