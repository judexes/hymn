<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>83</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THY WORD HAVE I HID IN MY HEART

<li>	Thy  Word is a lamp to my feet,
	A light to my path alway;
	To guide and to save me from sin,
	And show me the heavenly way.

<span>	Thy  word have I hid in my  heart,...
		That I might not sin against Thee,...
		That I might not sin, that I might not sin 
		Thy word have I hid in my heart.
</span>

</li><li>	Forever, O Lord, is Thy word 
	Established and fixed on high;
	Thy faithfulness unto all men 
	Abideth forever nigh.

</li><li>	At morning, at noon and at night
	I ever will give Thee praise;
	For Thou art my portion,O Lord,
	And shall be through all my days!

</li><li>	Thro’ Him whom Thy Word hath foretold,
	The Saviour and Morning Star,
	Salvation and peace have been bro’t
	To those who have strayed afar.

<span>	Thy  word have I hid in my  heart,...
		That I might not sin against Thee,...
		That I might not sin, that I might not sin 
		Thy word have I hid in my heart.
