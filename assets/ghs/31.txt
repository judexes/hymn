<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>31</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	HE TOUCHED ME</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Shackled by a heavy burden,
	’Neath a load of guilt and shame;
	Then the hand of Jesus touched me,
	And now I am no longer the same.
<span>	He touched me, Oh, He touched me, 
		And Oh, the joy that floods my soul;
		Something happened, and now I know,
		He touched me and made me whole.
</span>

</li><li>	Since I met this blessed Saviour,
	Since He cleansed and made me whole;
	I will never cease to praise Him,
	I’ll shout it while eternity rolls.

<span>	He touched me, Oh, He touched me, 
		And Oh, the joy that floods my soul;
		Something happened, and now I know,
		He touched me and made me whole.
