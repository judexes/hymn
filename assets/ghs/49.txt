<li>	While passing thro’ this world of sin,
	And others your life shall view,
	Be clean and pure without, within,
	Let others see Jesus in you.

<span>	Let others see Jesus in you ,.....
		Let others see Jesus in you,.....
		Keep telling the story, be faithful and true,
		Let others see Jesus  in you.

</li><li>	Your life’s a book before their eyes,
	They’re reading it thro’ and thro’;
	Say, does it point them to the skies,
	Do others see Jesus in you?

</li><li>	What joy ’twill be at set of sun,
	In mansions beyond the blue,
	To find some souls that you have won;
	Let others see Jesus in you.

</li><li>	Then live for Christ both day and night,
	Be faithful, be brave and true,
	And lead the lost to life and light;
	Let others see Jesus in you.

		Let others see Jesus in you,.....
		Keep telling the story, be faithful and true,
		Let others see Jesus  in you.
