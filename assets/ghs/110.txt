<li>	I’ll tell to all that God is love;
	For the world has never known
	The great compassion of His heart
	For the wayward and the lone.

<span>	Till the whole world knows,
		Till the whole world knows,
		I will shout and sing 
		Of Christ my King,
		Till the whole world knows.
</span>

</li><li>	I’ll tell of mercy’s boundless tide, 
	Like the waters of the sea,
	That covers ev’ry sin of man;
	’Tis salvation full and free.

</li><li>	I’ll tell of grace that keeps the soul,
	Of  abiding peace within,
	Of  faith that overcomes the world,
	With its tumult and its din.

</li><li>	Eternal glory is the goal
	That awaits the sons of light;
	

	Eternal darkness, black as death,
	For the children of the night.

<span>	Till the whole world knows,
		Till the whole world knows,
		I will shout and sing 
		Of Christ my King,
		Till the whole world knows.
</span>
