<li>	There’s a land that is fairer than day,
	And by faith we can see it afar,
	For  the Father waits over the way 
	To prepare us a dwelling place there.

<span>	In the sweet by and by ,
		We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
		In the sweet by and by,
		We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
</span>

</li><li>	We shall sing on that beautiful shore
	The melodious songs of the blest;
	And our spirits shall sorrow no more-
	Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

</li><li>	To our bountiful Father above 
	We will offer our tribute of praise,
	For the glorious gift of His love 
	And the blessings that hallow our days.


<span>	In the sweet by and by ,
		We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
		In the sweet by and by,
		We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
</span>
