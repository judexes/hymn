<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>177</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>SEARCH  ME,  O  GOD</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Search me, O God, and know my heart today;
	Try me, O Lord, and know my thoughts I pray;
	See if there be some wicked way in me,
	Cleanse me from ev’ry sin and set me free.

</li><li>	I praise Thee, Lord for cleansing me from sin;
	Fulfil Thy Word, and make me pure within;
	Fill me with fire, where once I burned with shame
	Grant my desire to magnify Thy name.

</li><li>	Lord, take my life, and make it wholly Thine;
	Fill my poor heart with Thy great love divine;
	Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
	I now surrender - Lord, in me abide.

</li><li>	O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;
	Send a revival - start the work in me:
	Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
	For blessing now, O Lord, I humbly plead.
