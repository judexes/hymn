 JESUS SHALL REIGN WHERE’ER THE  SUN</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
	Doth his successive journeys run;
	His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
	Till sun shall rise and set no more.

</li><li>	For Him shall endless prayer be made,
	And praises throng to crown His head;
	His name like sweet perfume shall rise
	With every morning sacrifice.

</li><li>	People and realms of every tongue 
	Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
	And infant voices shall proclaim
	Their young hosannas to His name.

</li><li>	Blessings abound where’er He reigns;
	The prisoner leaps to lose his chains;
	The weary find eternal rest;
	And all the sons of want are blest.

</li><li>	Where He displays His healing power;
	Death and the curse are known no more,
	In Him the tribes of Adam boast
	More blessings than their father lost.

</li><li>	Let every creature rise and bring,
	Its greatest honours to our King;
	Angels descend with songs again,
	And earth prolong the joyful strain.
