<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>64</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	THE OLD RUGGED CROSS</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
	The emblem of suff’ring and shame;
	And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
	For a world of lost sinners was slain.

<span>	So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,...
		Till my trophies at last I lay down;
		I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
		And exchange it some day for a crown.
</span>

</li><li>	O, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
	Has a wondrous attraction for me;
	For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
	To bear it to dark Calvary.	

</li><li>	In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
	A wondrous beauty I see;
	For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
	To pardon and sanctify me.

</li><li>	To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
	Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
	


	Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,
	Where His glory forever I’ll share.

<span>	So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,...
		Till my trophies at last I lay down;
		I will cling to the old rugged cross,...
		And exchange it some day for a crown.
