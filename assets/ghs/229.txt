<li>	Ho, my comrades! see the signal
	Waving in the sky!
	Reinforcements now appearing,
	Victory is nigh.

<span>	“Hold the fort, for I am coming,”
		Jesus signals still;
		Wave the answer back to heaven ,
		“By Thy grace we will.”
</span>

</li><li>	See the mighty host advancing,
	Satan leading on:
	
	Mighty men around us falling,
	Courage almost gone!

</li><li>	See the glorious banner waving!
	Hear the trumpet blow!
	In our Leader’s name we’ll triumph 
	Over every foe!

<span>	“Hold the fort, for I am coming,”
		Jesus signals still;
		Wave the answer back to heaven ,
		“By Thy grace we will.”
</span>


</li><li>	Fierce and long the battle rages,
	But our help is near:
	Onward comes our great Commander,
	Cheer, my comrades, cheer!
