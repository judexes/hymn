<li>	I know not why God’s wondrous grace
	To me He hath made known,
	Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
	Redeem’d me for His own.
<span>
		But I know whom I have believed,
		And am persuaded that He is able
		To keep that which I’ve committed
		Unto Him against that day.
</span>

</li><li>	I know not how this saving faith
	To me He did impart,
	Nor how believing in His Word
	Wrought peace within my heart.

</li><li>	I know not how the Spirit moves,
	Convincing men of sin,
	Revealing Jesus thro’ the Word,
	Creating faith in Him.

</li><li>	I know not what of good or ill
	May be reserved for me,
	Of weary ways or golden days
	Before His face I see.

</li><li>	I know not when my Lord may come,
	At night or noon-day fair,
	Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,
	Or “meet Him in the air.”
