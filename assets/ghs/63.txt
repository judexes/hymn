<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>63</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	WILL THERE BE ANY STARS?</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	I am thinking today of that beautiful land
	I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
	When thro’ wonderful grace by my Saviour I stand,
	Will there be any stars in my crown?

<span>		
		Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
		When at evening the sun goeth down?
		When I wake with the blest, in the mansions of rest,
		Will there be any stars in my crown?
</span>

</li><li>	In the strength of the Lord let me labour and pray,
	Let me watch as a winner of souls;
	That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,
	When His praise like the sea billows roll.

</li><li>	O what joy will it be when His face I behold,
	Living gems at His feet to lay down;
	It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold,
	Should there be any stars in my crown?

<span>		
		Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown,
		When at evening the sun goeth down?
		When I wake with the blest, in the mansions of rest,
		Will there be any stars in my crown?
