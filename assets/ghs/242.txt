	A GOOD HIGH PRIEST IS COME</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	A Good High Priest is come,
	Supplying Aaron’s place,
	And taking up his room,
	Dispensing life and grace,
	The law of Aaron’s priesthood came,
	But grace and truth by Jesus’ name.

</li><li>	He once temptations knew,
	And woes of every kind,
	That He might succour show
	To every tempted mind;
	In every point the Lamb was tried
	Like us, and then for us He died.

</li><li>	He died, but lives again,
	And by the altar stands;
	There shows how, He was slain,
	Opening His pierced hands;
	Our Priest abides, and pleads our cause,
	Transgressors of His righteous laws.

</li><li>	I other priests disclaim,
	Their laws and offerings too;
	None but the bleeding Lamb
	The mighty work can do;
	He shall have all the praise, for He
	Hath loved and lived and died for me.
