<li>	Joys are flowing like a river,
	Since the Comforter has come;
	He abides with us for ever,
	Makes the trusting heart His home.
		
<span>		
		Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
		What assurance in my soul !
		On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me,
		How the billows cease to roll.
</span>

</li><li>	Bringing life, and health, and gladness,
	All around this heav’nly Guest;
	Banish’d unbelief and sadness,
	Chang’d our weariness to rest.

</li><li>	Like the rain that falls from heaven,
	Like the sunlight from the sky,
	So the Holy Ghost is given,
	Coming on us from on high.
<span>		
		Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
		What assurance in my soul !
		On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me,
		How the billows cease to roll.
</span>


</li><li>	What a wonderful salvation,
	Where we always see His face;
	What a perfect habitation,
	What a quiet resting-place.
