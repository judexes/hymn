<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>193</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>ANOTHER YEAR</h4><ol id=“song”>   
<li>	Another year is dawning-
	A path unknown, untried,
	’Twould fill me with foreboding,
	Had I no hand to guide;
	But He who walked beside me
	All through the yesteryear,
	Whatever may betide me,
	Has promised to be near.


</li><li>	Another  year with Jesus!
	Ah, then, no dread I know.
	His love is ever precious,
	Howe’er the winds may blow.
	E’en when the storm is fiercest,
	In Him my soul may rest,
	And find sweet peace and comfort
	Upon his loving breast.

</li><li>	Another year to trust Him -
	Yes, I can trust Him  still,
	Who never yet has failed me
	As I have sought His will.
	His rod and staff He giveth
	To be my strength and stay,
	And tenderly He leadeth
	Along the homeward way.

</li><li>	Another year to serve Him,
	To labour for Him here,
	E’en while the shadows lengthen
	And night is drawing near.
	I know not when He’ll call me
	To lay my sickle by-
	Oh, may I then be faithful,
	While now the moments fly!

</li><li>	Another year to love Him,
	Whom I have loved so long;
	Another year to praise Him
	In  glad triumphant song.
	Whate’er the future holdeth,
	Of  sorrow, toil, or pain;
	His precious Love endureth
	Forevermore the same.

</li><li>	Another year with Jesus!
	I thank Thee, Lord, today
	For Thy unfailing presence
	Along life’s rugged way.
	Guide me, O blest Redeemer,
	Teach me to do Thy will,
	And Thy own perfect purpose
	In me each day fulfil.
