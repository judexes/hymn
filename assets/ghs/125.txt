<li>	Wonderful grace of Jesus, 
	Greater than all my sin;
	How shall my tongue describe it,
	Where shall its praise begin?
	Taking away my burden,
	Setting my spirit free,
	For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

<span>	Wonderful  the matchless grace of Jesus,
		Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
		Wonderful grace all sufficient for me, 
		  for even me
		Broader than the scope of my trangressions,
		Greater far than all my sin and shame, . . .
		O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
		Praise His name!
</span>

</li><li>	Wonderful grace of Jesus, 
	Reaching to all the lost,
	By it I have been pardoned,
	Saved to the uttermost,
	Chains have been torn assunder,
	Giving me liberty;
	For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.

</li><li>	Wonderful grace of Jesus,
	Reaching the most defiled,
	By its transforming power,
	Making him God’s dear child,
	Purchasing peace and heaven,
	For all eternity;
	And the wonderful grace of 
	Jesus reaches me.

		Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
		Wonderful grace all sufficient for me, 
		  for even me
		Broader than the scope of my trangressions,
		Greater far than all my sin and shame, . . .
		O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
		Praise His name!
