<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>108</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>MUST I GO AND EMPTY-HANDED? </h4><div id="badge-for-stanza">   

<li>	“Must I go, and empty-handed,”
	Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
	Not one day of service give Him,
	Lay no trophy at His feet?

<span>	“Must I go, and empty-handed?”
		Must I meet my Saviour so?
		Not one soul with which to greet Him:
		Must I empty-handed go?
</span>

</li><li>	Not at death I shrink nor falter,
	For my Saviour saves me now;
	But to meet Him empty-handed,
	Thought of that now clouds my brow.

</li><li>	O the years in sinning wasted,
	Could I but recall them now,
	I would give them to my Saviour,
	To His will I’d gladly bow.

</li><li>	O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
	Up and work while yet ’tis day;
	Ere the night of death o’er take thee,
	Strive for souls while still you may.


<span>	“Must I go, and empty-handed?”
		Must I meet my Saviour so?
		Not one soul with which to greet Him:
		Must I empty-handed go?
