<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>61</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>	LORD, SPEAK TO ME, THAT I MAY SPEAK

<li>	Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
	In living echoes of thy tone;
	As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
	Thy erring children lost and lone.

</li><li>	Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead
	The wandering and the wavering feet;
	O, feed me, Lord, that I may feed
	Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

</li><li>	Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand
	Firm on the Rock, and strong in Thee,
	I may stretch out a loving hand
	To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

</li><li>	Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach
	The precious things Thou dost impart;
	And wing my words, that they may reach
	The hidden depths of many a heart.

</li><li>	Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me,
	That I may speak with soothing power 
	A word in season, as from Thee,
	To weary ones in needful hour.


</li><li>	Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
	Until my very heart o’erflow
	In kindling thought, and glowing word,
	Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

</li><li>	Oh, use me, Lord, use even me,
	Just as Thou wilt, and how, and where;
	Until Thy blessed face I see,
	Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
