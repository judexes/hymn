<li>	‘Tis finished! the Messiah dies;
	Cut off for sins, but not His own:
	Accomplished is the sacrifice,
	The great redeeming work is done.

</li><li>	 ‘Tis finished! all the debt is paid;
	Justice divine is satisfied:
	The grand and full atonement made;
	God for a guilty world hath died.

</li><li>	The veil is rent in Christ alone;
	The living way to heaven is seen: 
	The middle wall is broken down;
	And all mankind may enter in.

</li><li>	The types and figures are fulfilled;
	Exacted is the legal pain:
	The precious promises are sealed;
	The spotless Lamb of God is slain.

</li><li>	The reign of sin and death is o’er;
	And all may live from sin set free:
	Satan hath lost his mortal power;
	‘Tis swallowed up in victory.


</li><li>	Saved from the legal curse I am;
	My Saviour hangs on yonder tree:
	See there the meek, expiring Lamb!
	‘Tis finished! He expires for me.

</li><li>	Accepted in the well-beloved;
	And clothed in righteousness divine:
	I see the bar to heaven removed;
	And all Thy merits, Lord, are mine.

</li><li>	Death, hell, and sin are now subdued;
	All grace is now to sinners given:
	And lo, I plead the atoning blood,
	And in Thy right I claim Thy heaven.
