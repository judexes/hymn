<li>	God has shown His loving face
	From His throne in heav’n above:
	And I’ve found a resting-place,
	In the shelter of His love.

<span>	I am resting, resting,
		Resting sweetly resting in His love;
		I am resting in His love,
		Resting in the shelter of His love.
</span>

</li><li>	When the cares of life oppress,
	When the sky is dark above;
	I can always find a rest,
	In the shelter of His love.

</li><li>	O, if you were never blest,
	With this peace from heav’n above;
	There’s for you a wondrous rest,
	In the shelter of His love.

<span>	I am resting, resting,
		Resting sweetly resting in His love;
		I am resting in His love,
		Resting in the shelter of His love.
</span>
