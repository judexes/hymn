<div class=“hymn”><h4 class=“hymn-num”>208</h4><h4 class=“hymn-title”>THE GREAT JUDGMENT MORNING</h4><ol id=“song”>   

 
<li>	I dreamed that the great judgment morning
	Had dawned and the trumpet had blown;
	I dreamed that the nations had gathered
	To judgment before the white throne;
	From the throne came a bright shining angel,
	And stood on the land and the sea,
	And swore with his hand raised to heaven,
	That time was no longer to be.

<span>	And O, what a weeping and wailing,
		As the lost were told of their fate;
		They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
		They prayed, but their prayer was too late.
</span>

</li><li>	The rich man was there, but his money
	Had melted and vanished away;
	A pauper he stood in the judgment,
	His debts were too heavy to pay;
	The great man was there, but his greatness,
	When death came, was left far behind!
	
	The angel that opened the records, 
	Not a trace of his greatness could find.

</li><li>	The widow was there with the orphans,
	God heard and remembered their cries;
	No sorrow in heaven for ever,
	God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
	The gambler was there and the drunkard,
	And the man that had sold them the drink,
	With the people who gave him the license,
	Together in hell they did sink.
<span>	And O, what a weeping and wailing,
		As the lost were told of their fate;
		They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
		They prayed, but their prayer was too late.
</span>


</li><li>	The moral man came to the judgment,
	But his self-righteous rags would not do;
	The men who had crucified Jesus
	Had passed off as moral men, too;
	The soul that had put off salvation,
	“Not tonight; I’ll get  saved by and by,
	No time now to think of religion!”
	At last they had found time to die.
